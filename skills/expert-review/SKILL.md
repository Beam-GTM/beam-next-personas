# Expert Review

Get quick, directional feedback from expert perspectives. Single pass, no iteration — just insights.

## When to Use

| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| "What do experts think?" | "Make this better" → use `expert-improve` |
| "Is this on the right track?" | "Polish until ready" → use `expert-improve` |
| "Give me rough feedback" | "Iterate until 7+/10" → use `expert-improve` |
| Early drafts, sanity checks | Final deliverables |

---

## Quick Start

**User says**: "review my LinkedIn post" / "expert feedback on this strategy"

**AI does** (auto-run, no questions):
1. Detect work type
2. Select top 3 personas
3. Run reviews
4. Show summary with actionable insights

**User only confirms**: Which personas to use (or accepts default)

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Receive & Detect (Auto)

When user provides content:

```
Got it. Let me get expert perspectives on this.

📋 Detected: [CONTENT TYPE] (e.g., LinkedIn post, GTM strategy, execution plan)

Recommended reviewers:
1. **[Persona 1]** — [Domain] | [1-line famous for]
2. **[Persona 2]** — [Domain] | [1-line famous for]  
3. **[Persona 3]** — [Domain] | [1-line famous for]

Running with these 3? (Enter = yes, or type numbers to change)
```

**Auto-detection rules**:

### Step 2: Run Reviews (Auto)

For each persona, load their file and generate review:

```

JUSTIN WELSH REVIEW
═══════════════════════════════════════

VERDICT: ⚠️ Needs Work

CORE REACTION:
"Good substance but the hook won't stop the scroll. You're burying the lead."

STRENGTHS:
• Specific example (Porsche case study) — builds credibility
• Teaching format with clear takeaway

GAPS:
• Hook is too generic ("I want to share...") → Start with the result
• No clear CTA → Add specific ask at end

ONE THING TO CHANGE:
Rewrite first line: "Porsche processed 1,247 invoices last month. Zero errors. Zero humans."

[... more reviews ...]

📊 EXPERT REVIEW SUMMARY

| Expert | Verdict | Key Insight |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Justin Welsh | ⚠️ Needs Work | Hook doesn't stop scroll |
| Ethan Mollick | 👌 Solid | Good data, needs sharper frame |
| Geoffrey Moore | 👌 Solid | Clear problem, audience could be narrower |

🎯 TOP 3 ACTIONS

1. Rewrite hook with surprising result — Flagged by Welsh, Mollick
2. Add specific CTA — Welsh recommends
3. Narrow audience signal — Moore suggests

⭐ WHAT WOULD MAKE THIS EXCELLENT

**Current Score: 6/10** — Good substance, weak packaging

**The Gap to Excellence:**

| Aspect | What You Did | What Excellence Looks Like |
|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Hook | Generic opener ("I want to share...") | Lead with surprising result or tension |
| Specificity | General AI automation benefits | Name, number, timeframe ("Porsche, 1,247 invoices, zero errors") |
| CTA | No clear next step | Specific ask that matches reader intent |

**Specific Phrases That Would Elevate:**

Instead of: "I want to share how we're using AI for automation"
Excellence: "Porsche processed 1,247 invoices last month. Zero errors. Zero humans. Here's how."

Instead of: [No CTA]
Excellence: "DM me 'INVOICE' if you want the playbook we used."

**The Excellence Framework for LinkedIn Posts:**
- First line must stop the scroll (surprising stat, counterintuitive claim, or tension)
- One concrete example beats three abstract benefits
- Clear CTA that matches the content and reader's likely intent

Want me to apply these? Say "improve this"

## Difference from `expert-improve`

| Aspect | `expert-review` | `expert-improve` |

| Passes | 1 | 2-3 until 7+/10 |
| Output | Insights + actions | Improved version |
| Speed | Fast (~1 min) | Thorough (~5 min) |
