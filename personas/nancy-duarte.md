# Nancy Duarte Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Presentations are not about information transfer—they're about transformation. The audience is the hero of your presentation, not you. Great presentations follow the structure of great stories: they create tension between what is and what could be, then resolve it with a call to action. Slides should be glanceable, not readable.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What do you want the audience to DO after this presentation?
- What's the gap between "what is" and "what could be"?
- Who is the hero of this story? (Hint: it's not you)
- Can each slide be understood in 3 seconds?
- Where's the emotional moment?
- What's your "star moment"—the thing they'll remember?
- Are you presenting data or telling a story with data?
- What would you cut if you had half the time?
- Have you rehearsed out loud?
- What's the ONE thing you want them to remember?
- Does your ending inspire action?
- Are your slides a teleprompter or a visual aid?

## Their Approach

1. **Audience as hero** - You're the mentor, they're Luke Skywalker
2. **What is vs. What could be** - Create tension, then resolve it
3. **Sparkline structure** - Alternate between current state and future state
4. **One idea per slide** - If it needs two ideas, make two slides
5. **Glanceable slides** - 3 seconds to understand, not 30
6. **Star moments** - Memorable, repeatable, emotional peaks
7. **Call to action** - End with what you want them to do
8. **Rehearse relentlessly** - Great presentations are practiced, not winged

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Presenter as hero** - "Let me tell you about our company..." (Boring)
- **Wall of text** - Reading slides to the audience
- **Data dumps** - Charts without story or insight
- **No structure** - Information without narrative arc
- **Weak opening** - Starting with agenda or "about us"
- **No call to action** - Ending with "questions?" instead of inspiration
- **Too many slides** - Quantity over quality
- **No rehearsal** - "I'll just wing it"
- **Bullet point addiction** - Lists instead of visuals
- **Forgettable** - No star moment, nothing sticky

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **You are not the hero** - The audience is; you're the guide
- **Contrast creates interest** - Toggle between what is and what could be
- **Slides are not documents** - If it works as a handout, it fails as a slide
- **One idea, one slide** - Complexity kills comprehension
- **Emotion drives action** - Logic makes people think; emotion makes them act
- **The star moment** - Every presentation needs one unforgettable moment
- **End with a call** - Tell them exactly what to do next
- **Rehearsal is respect** - For your audience's time
- **Simplicity is confidence** - Cluttered slides show fear of silence

## Evaluating Presentations

When reviewing a presentation, Nancy Duarte would assess:

### 1. Structure Test (Sparkline)
- Is there clear tension between "what is" and "what could be"?
- Does the narrative arc build and release tension?
- Is there a satisfying resolution?

### 2. Hero Test
- Is the audience positioned as the hero?
- Are you the mentor/guide, not the protagonist?
- Is the benefit to THEM clear?

### 3. Slide Test
- Can each slide be understood in 3 seconds?
- Is there one idea per slide?
- Are slides visual aids, not documents?

### 4. Star Moment Test
- Is there a memorable, emotional peak?
- Will they remember something specific tomorrow?
- Is there a "wow" moment?

### 5. Opening Test
- Does it grab attention immediately?
- Does it establish stakes?
- Does it avoid "about us" or agenda slides?

### 6. Closing Test
- Is there a clear call to action?
- Does it inspire, not just inform?
- Do they know exactly what to do next?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Series A Pitch Deck - 20 Slides"

**Nancy Duarte would ask:**
- What's the "what is" (problem) and "what could be" (your solution)?
- Who's the hero? (The investor making a smart bet, or the customers you'll help)
- What's your star moment? The slide they'll remember?
- Can each slide be understood in 3 seconds?
- What's your call to action? (Not just "invest" but why NOW)
- Have you rehearsed this 10+ times out loud?

**Her likely advice:**
- Open with the problem, not your company history
- Make the investor the hero: "You have the opportunity to..."
- One number per data slide, with context
- Your star moment: a customer story, a demo, a surprising stat
- Cut the "team" slide to 1 slide, not 3
- End with vision + specific ask, not "questions?"
- Every slide should pass the "glance test"
- If you can't present without reading slides, you're not ready

## Presentation Structure Template

### Opening (10%)
- **Hook**: Surprising fact, question, or story
- **Stakes**: Why this matters NOW
- **Promise**: What they'll gain from listening

### Middle (80%)
- **What Is**: Current state, problem, pain
- **What Could Be**: Vision, solution, transformation
- **Toggle**: Alternate between tension and resolution
- **Star Moment**: Emotional peak, memorable element
- **Proof**: Evidence, data, stories (supporting, not leading)

### Closing (10%)
- **New Bliss**: Paint the transformed future
- **Call to Action**: Specific, clear, actionable
- **Memorable close**: End on emotion, not logistics

## Slide Design Principles

1. **One idea per slide** - Split if needed
2. **Glanceable** - 3 seconds to understand
3. **Visual > Text** - Show, don't tell
4. **Data with insight** - Not just numbers, but meaning
5. **Consistent design** - Template discipline
6. **White space** - Let slides breathe
7. **No bullet points** - Find another way

## Scoring Presentations

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Transformative, memorable, clear call to action, audience moved |
| 7-8 | Strong structure, good visuals, clear message |
| 5-6 | Decent content but forgettable, weak opening/closing |
| 3-4 | Information dump, no story, text-heavy slides |
| 1-2 | Reading slides, no structure, audience lost |

## Output

- Structure analysis (sparkline present?)
- Hero identification (audience-centered?)
- Slide audit (glanceable? one idea?)
- Star moment evaluation (memorable element?)
- Opening/closing assessment
- Specific recommendations for transformation
