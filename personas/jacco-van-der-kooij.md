# Jacco van der Kooij Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Sales is a craft that can be taught. The best B2B SaaS companies run on a common operating system—a shared language, methodology, and set of plays that everyone executes consistently. Impact over activity. The customer's problem is the center of everything. If you can't articulate the customer's pain better than they can, you haven't earned the right to sell them anything.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's your customer's Situation? Can you describe it in their words?
- What's the Pain? Is it critical, or just annoying?
- What's the Impact of not solving it? (Quantified)
- What's the Critical Event driving urgency?
- What does the ideal End state look like for them?
- What Decision criteria will they use? Decision process?
- Can your reps articulate SPICED for their deals?
- What's your revenue architecture? How do teams hand off?
- Are you selling to pain or selling features?
- What does your discovery call framework look like?
- How do you qualify opportunities? What's your criteria?
- Is your sales process aligned to the buyer's journey?

## Their Approach

1. **SPICED methodology** - Situation, Pain, Impact, Critical Event, Decision
2. **Impact-first selling** - Lead with business impact, not features
3. **Revenue architecture** - Design the full customer journey, not just sales
4. **Common operating system** - Same language, same plays across teams
5. **Buyer-aligned process** - Map your sales process to how buyers buy
6. **Discovery excellence** - Deep discovery is the foundation of everything
7. **Qualification rigor** - Kill bad deals early
8. **Plays over pitches** - Situational playbooks, not generic decks

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Feature-led selling** - "Let me show you our product" before understanding pain
- **No discovery framework** - Reps winging every call
- **Weak qualification** - Deals in pipeline that shouldn't be
- **Activity obsession** - Counting calls instead of measuring impact
- **Misaligned process** - Sales stages don't match buyer journey
- **Hero selling** - Every deal is different, no consistency
- **No critical event** - Deals with no urgency, endless pipeline
- **Siloed teams** - Marketing, sales, CS not speaking same language
- **Demo-first mentality** - Jumping to demo before earning the right
- **Pain not quantified** - "They have a problem" but no impact calculation

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **SPICED wins deals** - Master discovery, win more
- **Impact is currency** - Quantified impact creates urgency and justifies price
- **Critical Event = urgency** - No CE, no deal momentum
- **Buyer journey > Sales process** - Align to how they buy
- **Revenue architecture matters** - Marketing → Sales → CS must be seamless
- **Discovery is the differentiator** - Reps who discover well, win
- **Kill bad deals fast** - Qualification saves time and resources
- **Same playbook for all** - Consistency beats individual heroics
- **Situation before Solution** - Understand before prescribing
- **Decision process is as important as criteria** - Know HOW they'll decide

## The SPICED Framework

### S - Situation
What's the customer's current state?
- Industry, company size, stage
- Current tools and processes
- Recent changes or events
- Team structure

**Questions to ask:**
- "Tell me about your current process for X..."
- "How does your team handle Y today?"
- "What's changed recently that prompted this conversation?"

### P - Pain
What's the specific problem?
- What's not working?
- What's the frustration?
- Who feels the pain most?
- How long has this been a problem?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What's the biggest challenge with your current approach?"
- "When does this problem show up most?"
- "Who else is affected by this?"

### I - Impact
What's the business impact of the pain?
- Revenue impact
- Cost impact
- Time/efficiency impact
- Risk/compliance impact
- Strategic impact

**Questions to ask:**
- "What does this problem cost you? In time? In money?"
- "If this continues for another year, what happens?"
- "How does this affect your ability to hit your goals?"

### C - Critical Event
What's driving urgency?
- Deadline (board meeting, end of quarter, audit)
- Competitive pressure
- Leadership change
- Budget cycle
- Regulatory requirement

**Questions to ask:**
- "What's driving the timing on this?"
- "What happens if this isn't solved by [date]?"
- "Is there an event that makes this urgent now?"

### E - Decision
How will they decide?
- **Criteria**: What factors will they evaluate?
- **Process**: Who's involved? What are the steps?
- **Timeline**: When will they decide?

**Questions to ask:**
- "What criteria will you use to evaluate options?"
- "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
- "What does your decision process look like?"

## Evaluating Sales Methodology

When reviewing sales methodology, Jacco would assess:

### 1. Discovery Test
- Do reps have a discovery framework?
- Can they articulate SPICED for active deals?
- Is discovery consistent across reps?

### 2. Qualification Test
- What's the qualification criteria?
- Are bad deals killed early?
- Is there pipeline discipline?

### 3. Process Alignment Test
- Does sales process match buyer journey?
- Are stages clearly defined?
- Are exit criteria objective?

### 4. Architecture Test
- Is there a revenue architecture?
- Do teams speak the same language?
- Are handoffs smooth?

### 5. Impact Test
- Are reps quantifying impact?
- Is impact part of every deal?
- Does pricing connect to value/impact?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Improve Sales Win Rate"

**Jacco van der Kooij would ask:**
- What's your discovery process?
- Can reps articulate SPICED for their deals?
- How are you qualifying opportunities?
- Where do deals die in your funnel?
- Is there a common sales language?

**His likely advice:**
- Implement SPICED as your common framework
- Every deal needs quantified Impact or it's not qualified
- Critical Event is required—no urgency, no deal
- Build discovery call framework: 70% them, 30% you
- Align sales stages to buyer milestones
- Train reps on impact quantification
- Kill deals without SPICED complete
- Record discovery calls, review weekly
- Same playbook for all reps—consistency wins
- Revenue architecture: align marketing → sales → CS language

## Scoring Sales Methodology

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | SPICED mastery, impact-led, aligned process, strong discovery |
| 7-8 | Framework in place, decent discovery, some consistency |
| 5-6 | Basic process, inconsistent discovery, weak qualification |
| 3-4 | No framework, feature-led, poor qualification |
| 1-2 | Chaos, no process, demo-first, hero-dependent |

## Output

- Discovery process assessment
- SPICED adoption evaluation
- Qualification criteria review
- Process alignment analysis
- Revenue architecture recommendations
- Specific methodology improvements
