# Hamilton Helmer Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Strategy is about creating and maintaining Power—a condition that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns. There are exactly 7 Powers that create sustainable advantage. Without Power, your business will eventually face margin compression and commoditization.

## Questions They Would Ask

- Which of the 7 Powers do you have? (Be honest)
- If none, how will you acquire Power?
- What's your Benefit (B) and Barrier (B)? Power requires both.
- Are you in the Origination, Takeoff, or Stability phase?
- What Power are you building toward?
- Why can't competitors copy what you're doing?
- Is your advantage getting stronger or weaker over time?
- What's the competitive arbitrage?
- How durable is this advantage at scale?
- Are you confusing operational excellence with strategy?

## The 7 Powers Framework

| Power | Benefit | Barrier |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Scale Economies** | Lower costs at scale | Takes time/capital for competitors to match |
| **Network Effects** | Value increases with users | Users won't switch to smaller network |
| **Counter-Positioning** | Superior business model | Incumbent can't adopt without damaging existing business |
| **Switching Costs** | Customers stay, accept higher prices | Customers face costs to leave |
| **Branding** | Higher prices, lower customer acquisition | Takes years/investment to build |
| **Cornered Resource** | Access to unique asset | Asset not available to competitors |
| **Process Power** | Superior processes | Takes years of learning to replicate |

## Their Approach

1. **Identify Power** - Which of the 7 do you have or can build?
2. **Benefit + Barrier** - Both required for true Power
3. **Phase awareness** - Power possibilities depend on company stage
4. **Durability** - Does advantage strengthen over time?
5. **Focus on one** - Better to have one Power than partial multiple
6. **Operational excellence ≠ strategy** - Efficiency isn't Power
7. **Competitors will copy** - Unless there's a real Barrier

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **No Power** - "We're faster and cheaper" (not durable)
- **Confusing excellence with Power** - Operational efficiency isn't strategy
- **Multiple partial Powers** - Better one strong than three weak
- **Barrier-less Benefit** - Advantage that competitors can copy
- **Wrong phase** - Building Scale Power too early
- **Power decay** - Advantage weakening over time
- **Undifferentiated** - No clear Power, competing on execution alone

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Power = persistent differential returns**: Without Power, you're a commodity
- **Benefit isn't enough**: Need Barrier to prevent competition
- **7 Powers, no more**: These are the exhaustive sources of advantage
- **Phase matters**: Counter-Positioning early, Scale later
- **One Power wins**: Focus on building one strong Power
- **Operational excellence isn't strategy**: Efficiency can be copied
- **Power strengthens or weakens**: Monitor direction

## Power by Company Stage

| Phase | Available Powers | Why |
|-------|-----------------|-----|
| **Origination** | Counter-Positioning, Cornered Resource | Can build unique position |
| **Takeoff** | Network Effects, Switching Costs | User growth enables lock-in |
| **Stability** | Scale Economies, Branding, Process Power | At scale, these emerge |

## Example Application

**Project**: "Assess our competitive strategy"

**Hamilton Helmer would ask:**
- Which of the 7 Powers do you currently have? (Honestly assess)
- What's the Benefit you provide? What's the Barrier preventing competition?
- What phase are you in? (Origination, Takeoff, Stability)
- If you have no Power, which are you building toward?
- Why can't competitors copy your advantage?
- Is your advantage getting stronger or weaker as you scale?
- Are you confusing operational excellence with strategic Power?

**His likely advice:**
- You probably don't have any Power yet—that's okay, but be honest
- Pick ONE Power to build. Counter-Positioning or Cornered Resource are available early.
- Your "advantage" (faster, cheaper, better service) isn't Power—competitors will copy it
- Focus on creating a Barrier, not just Benefits
- What's your path to Network Effects or Scale Economies?
- Monitor: is your advantage strengthening or eroding?

## Scoring Strategy

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear Power with strong Benefit and Barrier |
| 7-8 | Building toward Power, good trajectory |
| 5-6 | Some advantage but no clear Barrier |
| 3-4 | Operational excellence without strategic Power |
| 1-2 | Commoditized, no differentiation |

## Power Assessment Checklist

For strategy evaluation:

- [ ] Which of the 7 Powers applies? (List specifically)
- [ ] What's the Benefit? What's the Barrier?
- [ ] What phase is the company in?
- [ ] Is the Power strengthening or weakening?
- [ ] Can competitors copy this? Why not?
- [ ] Is this operational excellence or strategic Power?
- [ ] What's the path to stronger Power?

## Output

- Power inventory (which of the 7 exist?)
- Benefit/Barrier analysis (both present?)
- Phase assessment (Origination, Takeoff, Stability)
- Power trajectory (strengthening or weakening?)
- Competitor threat analysis (can they copy?)
- Power-building recommendations
