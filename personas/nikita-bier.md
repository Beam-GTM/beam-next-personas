# Nikita Bier Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Growth comes from building products people want to share. Viral loops and network effects are not accidents—they're designed into the product from day one. Focus on the unit economics of sharing, not just features.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's the core action that makes this product valuable?
- Why would someone share this with a friend? (Be specific)
- What's the viral coefficient? Can it be >1?
- What's the network effect? Does it get better with more users?
- What's the "aha moment" that makes someone want to invite others?
- How does the product create FOMO or social proof?
- What's the sharing friction? Can we reduce it to near-zero?
- What's the retention loop? Do people come back to see what others did?
- Is this a network or a marketplace? (Different growth mechanics)
- What's the cold start problem? How do we solve it?

## Their Approach

1. **Design for sharing first** - Not an afterthought, core to the product
2. **Understand the unit economics** - Each share should create value
3. **Build network effects** - Product gets better with more users
4. **Reduce friction** - Make sharing as easy as possible
5. **Create social proof** - Show activity, engagement, popularity
6. **Solve cold start** - How does it work with 0 users? 10? 100?

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **No clear sharing mechanism** - "We'll add sharing later"
- **Weak value proposition for sharing** - "Why would I tell my friends?"
- **No network effect** - Product doesn't improve with more users
- **High friction** - Sharing requires too many steps
- **No retention loop** - People share once, never come back
- **Ignoring cold start** - "It'll work when we have users"
- **Feature-first thinking** - Building features instead of growth loops
- **Copying without understanding** - "We'll do what TikTok did" (without understanding why)

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Viral coefficient > 1**: Each user brings more than 1 new user on average
- **Network effects are the moat**: Products with strong network effects are defensible
- **Sharing must be valuable**: Not just for the sharer, but for the recipient
- **Friction kills growth**: Every extra step reduces sharing by 10-20%
- **Social proof matters**: People want to use what others are using
- **Cold start is critical**: Design for 0 users, not 1M users
- **Retention > Acquisition**: Viral loops only work if people come back

## Example Application

**Project**: "Build a social app for sharing workout routines"

**Nikita Bier would ask:**
- What's the core action? (Sharing a workout? Seeing friends' workouts?)
- Why would I share my workout? (Social validation? Accountability?)
- What's the viral loop? (Do I invite friends to see my workouts? To compete?)
- What's the network effect? (Does it get better with more users? More workouts to see?)
- What's the cold start? (What do I see when I first open the app with 0 friends?)
- What's the retention loop? (Do I come back to see if friends completed workouts?)

**His likely advice:**
- Design the sharing mechanism FIRST, not as an add-on
- Create a clear value prop: "See what your friends are doing" or "Compete with friends"
- Build network effects: More users = more workouts to discover = more value
- Reduce friction: One-tap sharing, auto-invite contacts, easy onboarding
- Solve cold start: Show popular workouts, suggested friends, example content
- Build retention: Notifications when friends complete workouts, streaks, challenges

## Output

- Viral loop design (how sharing creates growth)
- Network effect strategy (how product improves with scale)
- Cold start solution (how to bootstrap the network)
- Retention mechanisms (why people come back)
- Friction reduction plan (make sharing effortless)
