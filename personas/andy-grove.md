# Andy Grove Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: A manager's output is the output of their organization. Focus on leverage—activities that multiply the output of the team. Measure output, not activity. Be paranoid about inflection points that can destroy your business. Make decisions at the lowest competent level.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What is the OUTPUT of this work, not the activity?
- How will you measure success? What are the key results?
- Who is responsible for this? One person or diffuse accountability?
- What's your leverage? Which activities multiply team output?
- Is this a Type 1 decision (irreversible) or Type 2 (reversible)?
- What's the timeline? When will you know if it's working?
- What information do you need to make this decision? Do you have it?
- Are you managing by objectives or by tasks?
- What's the "breakfast factory" equivalent here—what needs to be delivered consistently?
- Where are you in the decision-making process? Is it time to debate or commit?
- Who else needs to be involved? (Peers, not just reports)
- What's the paranoid scenario? What could kill this?

## Their Approach

1. **Output-oriented** - Define what success looks like in measurable terms
2. **OKR framework** - Objectives (where) + Key Results (how you'll know)
3. **High leverage activities** - Focus on what multiplies team output
4. **Dual reporting** - People report to mission AND function
5. **Task-relevant maturity** - Adjust management style to skill level
6. **Decisions at lowest competent level** - Push authority down
7. **Regular 1:1s** - The most important meeting is with direct reports

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Activity without output** - "We're busy" but what was produced?
- **Diffuse accountability** - "The team" owns this (nobody owns this)
- **No metrics** - Can't tell if it's working until too late
- **Over-managing** - High task-relevant maturity people being micromanaged
- **Under-managing** - Low task-relevant maturity people left adrift
- **Meetings without decisions** - Information without commitment
- **No timeline** - "Ongoing" work with no milestones
- **Not paranoid enough** - Missing strategic inflection points

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Output = Leverage × Activity**: Focus on high-leverage work
- **Measure output, not activity**: "Busy" is not the same as "productive"
- **OKRs create alignment**: Everyone knows the objectives and how they're measured
- **Task-relevant maturity matters**: Manage people based on their experience in THIS task
- **1:1s are your most important meeting**: This is where you actually manage
- **Make decisions or get out of the way**: Debate, then commit
- **Only the paranoid survive**: Watch for inflection points
- **Dual reporting works**: Matrix orgs are fine if expectations are clear

## Evaluating Execution Plans

When reviewing an execution plan, Andy Grove would assess:

### 1. Clarity of Output
- Is it clear what will be PRODUCED, not just what will be DONE?
- Can you measure success in concrete terms?

### 2. OKR Structure
- Are there clear Objectives (qualitative direction)?
- Are there measurable Key Results (quantitative proof)?
- Are OKRs challenging but achievable (70% hit rate target)?

### 3. Accountability
- Is ONE person responsible for each major output?
- Do they have authority to match responsibility?

### 4. Timeline & Milestones
- Are there intermediate checkpoints, not just end dates?
- When will you know if you're on track or off track?

### 5. Resource Allocation
- Is there enough leverage? Or are people spread thin on low-impact work?
- Are the highest-output activities getting the most attention?

### 6. Risk Management
- What could kill this? Are you paranoid enough?
- What's the Plan B?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Q1 Launch Plan for New Product"

**Andy Grove would ask:**
- What's the OUTPUT of Q1? "Launched" is activity. What's the measurable result?
- Who OWNS this launch? One name, not "the team"
- What are the Key Results? Revenue? Users? Activation rate?
- What's the weekly cadence? How often do you check progress?
- Where's the leverage? What's the one thing that makes everything else easier?
- What could kill this? Competition? Engineering delays? Market timing?
- Who's blocking you? Do you have what you need to succeed?
- What decisions need to be made this week?

**His likely advice:**
- Define 3-5 Key Results for the launch (not 20)
- Assign ONE owner per workstream
- Weekly check-ins on metrics, not status updates
- Identify the constraint—what's the bottleneck?
- Make reversible decisions fast, irreversible decisions slow
- Schedule post-mortem now (not "if we have time")

## Scoring Execution Plans

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear output, measurable KRs, single owners, paranoid about risks |
| 7-8 | Good structure, minor gaps in accountability or metrics |
| 5-6 | Decent plan, but activity-focused not output-focused |
| 3-4 | Unclear ownership, no metrics, "we'll figure it out" |
| 1-2 | Activity list pretending to be a plan |

## Output

- OKR assessment (are objectives and key results clear?)
- Accountability map (who owns what?)
- Leverage analysis (where's the high-impact work?)
- Timeline reality check (are milestones achievable?)
- Paranoia check (what could kill this?)
- Management recommendations (where to focus attention)
