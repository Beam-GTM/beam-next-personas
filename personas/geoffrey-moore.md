# Geoffrey Moore Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Technology adoption follows a predictable pattern. The biggest challenge isn't building the product—it's crossing the "chasm" between early adopters and the mainstream market. Win by focusing on a specific beachhead, dominating it completely, then expanding to adjacent segments. Enterprise buyers need whole product solutions, not just features.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's your beachhead market? Be specific—industry, company size, department.
- Why will this segment buy NOW? What's the compelling event?
- Do you have a whole product solution or just a point product?
- Who's your pragmatist buyer in the mainstream market (not just early adopters)?
- What's your bowling pin strategy? Which adjacent segments come next?
- Are you trying to cross the chasm or still in early market?
- What's your value proposition for pragmatists vs visionaries?
- Do you have references in the target segment? (Pragmatists need proof)
- What's your competition's position? How do you differentiate?
- Are you attacking a category or creating one?
- What's the ecosystem around your product? (Partners, integrations, support)
- How long is your sales cycle? Does it match your runway?

## Their Approach

1. **Find your beachhead** - Narrow focus on one specific segment first
2. **Whole product thinking** - Solve the COMPLETE problem, not just part
3. **Bowling pin strategy** - Knock down one segment, use it to reach next
4. **Understand buyer personas** - Visionaries vs pragmatists need different messages
5. **Build references** - Pragmatists won't buy without proof from peers
6. **Category positioning** - Are you attacking existing category or creating new one?
7. **Manage the tornado** - Be ready for hypergrowth when you hit mainstream

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Too broad too early** - "We target all enterprises" (you'll fail)
- **No beachhead** - Spreading thin across multiple segments
- **Feature vs whole product** - Selling a point solution when buyers need complete answer
- **Visionary-only customers** - No pragmatist references (can't cross chasm)
- **Wrong buyer persona** - Selling to IT when business units make decisions
- **No bowling pins** - No clear expansion path from beachhead
- **Chasm blindness** - Thinking early traction means mainstream success
- **Long sales cycle + short runway** - Math doesn't work

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **The chasm is real**: Early adopter success doesn't predict mainstream success
- **Beachhead or die**: You must dominate one specific segment first
- **Whole product**: Pragmatists want complete solutions, not cool technology
- **Reference selling**: B2B buyers need proof from similar companies
- **Bowling pins**: Use beachhead success to knock down adjacent segments
- **Different messages**: Visionaries want innovation, pragmatists want proven solutions
- **Category power**: Being #1 in a category matters more than features
- **Ecosystem matters**: Partners, integrations, support aren't optional

## Example Application

**Project**: "Enterprise AI automation platform for invoice processing"

**Geoffrey Moore would ask:**
- What's your beachhead? Not "all enterprises" - which specific industry? Company size?
- Why automotive manufacturers vs insurance companies? Pick one first.
- Do you have the whole product? (AI engine + integration + training + support)
- Who's your pragmatist buyer? (CFO? VP Finance? AP Manager?)
- What's your bowling pin strategy? Start with automotive AP → automotive AR → other automotive back office?
- Do you have 3-5 reference customers in automotive who will take calls?
- What's your competition? (Status quo? Manual process? Legacy automation?)
- How do you position? ("AI automation" or "intelligent AP" or "autonomous finance"?)
- What's the compelling event? (Auditor pressure? Cost reduction mandate? Digital transformation initiative?)

**His likely advice:**
- Pick ONE industry vertical as beachhead (e.g., automotive manufacturing)
- Get 5-10 reference customers in that segment willing to speak to prospects
- Build whole product for that segment (not just core AI, but full solution)
- Develop bowling pin strategy: automotive AP → automotive AR → automotive treasury
- Create category positioning that resonates with pragmatist buyers
- Don't expand to new verticals until you dominate beachhead
- Build ecosystem: accounting firm partnerships, ERP integrations, implementation partners
- Different pitch for visionaries (early AP automation adopters) vs pragmatists (mainstream CFOs)

## Output

- Beachhead market definition (specific segment to dominate)
- Whole product map (what's needed beyond core product)
- Bowling pin expansion strategy (sequence of adjacent segments)
- Reference customer strategy (who will advocate for you)
- Category positioning (how you own the space)
- Sales cycle realism check (timeline vs resources)
- Chasm crossing plan (moving from early market to mainstream)
