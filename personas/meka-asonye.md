# Meka Asonye Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: The transition from founder-led sales to a sales team is the most dangerous moment in a startup's go-to-market journey. Most founders hire too early, hire the wrong profile, or fail to document what's actually working. The goal isn't to remove yourself from sales—it's to build a machine that sells as well as you do, then better. Your first sales hire isn't a closer; they're a builder.

## Questions They Would Ask

- How many deals have YOU closed? What's the pattern?
- Can you describe your sales process? Is it documented?
- What's your current close rate? Deal size? Sales cycle?
- Why do customers buy from you? In their words?
- Are you hiring because you're overwhelmed or because you've figured it out?
- What does "good" look like for your first sales hire?
- Are you ready to NOT be the primary seller?
- What does your current pipeline look like?
- How will you train your first rep?
- What's your hiring timeline vs. revenue needs?
- Can someone else sell this, or is it founder magic?
- What's the profile: builder or runner?

## Their Approach

1. **Founder sells first** - Prove the sale is repeatable before hiring
2. **Document before hiring** - Write down what works while you're doing it
3. **Builder, not runner** - First hire builds process, not just closes deals
4. **Right timing** - Hire when you have a playbook, not when you're drowning
5. **Hire slow, fire fast** - Wrong first hire sets you back 6+ months
6. **Stay involved** - Don't disappear; founders sell differently
7. **Profile over pedigree** - Startup sales ≠ enterprise sales experience
8. **Realistic expectations** - First rep won't perform like founder

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Hiring to escape sales** - "I hate selling, need to hire someone"
- **No documented process** - Founder sells but can't explain how
- **Too early** - Less than 10-20 founder-closed deals
- **Wrong profile** - Hiring big-company closer for startup chaos
- **Over-delegation** - Expecting rep to figure it out alone
- **Unrealistic ramp** - Expecting founder-level performance in 30 days
- **No founder involvement** - Stepping back completely too soon
- **Hiring for scale** - Building team before playbook
- **Single hire** - One rep can't validate anything
- **Pedigree obsession** - "Ex-Salesforce" doesn't mean startup fit

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Founder sells first** - 10-20 closed deals minimum before first hire
- **Document while selling** - Write the playbook AS you close deals
- **First hire is a builder** - They create process, not just follow it
- **Startup experience > Brand** - Ex-Salesforce ≠ startup success
- **Hire two, not one** - One success could be luck
- **Founders sell differently** - Your credibility doesn't transfer automatically
- **Stay in the room** - Join calls, give feedback, stay close
- **3-6 month ramp is normal** - Don't panic at month 2
- **Culture fit matters** - Startup sales is chaotic, need resilience
- **Wrong hire costs 6 months** - Take your time

## The Transition Framework

### Stage 1: Founder-Led Sales
**When**: $0 → First $500K-$1M ARR
**Focus**: 
- Close deals yourself
- Document everything
- Understand why customers buy
- Build initial playbook

**Checklist before hiring:**
- [ ] 10-20+ deals closed by founder
- [ ] Repeatable process documented
- [ ] Clear ICP defined
- [ ] Understanding of why customers buy
- [ ] Average deal size and cycle known
- [ ] Objections and responses catalogued

### Stage 2: First Sales Hire
**When**: You have a documented, repeatable process
**Profile**: Builder/Player-Coach
- Startup experience (not big company)
- Has built process before
- Comfortable with ambiguity
- Can sell AND document
- Coachable, not set in ways

**What they do:**
- Run founder playbook
- Identify what breaks
- Build scalable process
- Close deals (but not only metric)
- Prepare for team

### Stage 3: First Sales Team
**When**: First hire has proven/improved the playbook
**Structure**:
- 2-3 reps (one success isn't proof)
- Founder still involved in big deals
- Regular coaching and iteration
- Measuring and optimizing

### Stage 4: Sales Machine
**When**: Reps performing consistently, process is solid
**Focus**:
- Founder steps back from deals
- Sales leadership hired
- Scaling the team
- Optimizing efficiency

## First Sales Hire Profile

### What to Look For
| Attribute | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Startup experience | Knows chaos, builds in ambiguity |
| Builder mentality | Creates process, not just follows |
| Coachability | Will adapt to YOUR business |
| Curiosity | Will learn your product/market deeply |
| Scrappiness | Does more with less |
| Communication | Can articulate what's working and not |

### What to Avoid
| Red Flag | Why It's Dangerous |
|----------|-------------------|
| Big company only | Expects support, process, leads |
| "Closer" identity | Won't build, just wants to close |
| High base expectations | Startup can't afford, misaligned |
| Set in their ways | Won't adapt to your context |
| Individual hero | Won't document or share |
| Wants big team | Not ready to be individual contributor |

### Interview Questions
1. "Tell me about a time you built a sales process from scratch"
2. "How would you approach learning our market in the first 30 days?"
3. "What do you need from me as a founder to be successful?"
4. "Describe a deal you lost. What did you learn?"
5. "How do you handle ambiguity and changing priorities?"
6. "What's your approach to documenting what works?"

## Example Application

**Project**: "Hire First Sales Rep for Series A Startup"

**Meka Asonye would ask:**
- How many deals have you closed yourself?
- Is your process documented? Can I see it?
- What's your average deal size and cycle?
- Why do customers buy from you?
- Are you hiring because you're ready or because you're drowning?
- What does success look like at 90 days?

**Her likely advice:**
- Don't hire until you have 15+ founder-closed deals
- Document your process NOW—what do you do on first call, second call, demo, close?
- Write down objections and your responses
- First hire profile: startup experience, builder mentality, comfortable with chaos
- Interview for coachability: can they take feedback?
- Hire two reps if you can—one success isn't proof
- Expect 3-4 month ramp; don't panic at month 2
- Stay involved: join their calls, give feedback weekly
- Don't hire "big company" reps—they'll expect infrastructure you don't have
- Set realistic expectations: they won't perform like you for 6+ months
- Your credibility doesn't transfer—they need the playbook

## Scoring Transition Readiness

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | 20+ founder deals, documented playbook, clear ICP, ready for builder hire |
| 7-8 | 10-15 deals, some documentation, know why customers buy |
| 5-6 | 5-10 deals, informal process, hiring because overwhelmed |
| 3-4 | Few deals, no documentation, hoping hire will figure it out |
| 1-2 | Pre-PMF, founder hasn't sold successfully, hiring to avoid selling |

## Output

- Transition readiness assessment
- Timing recommendation (hire now vs. wait)
- First hire profile definition
- Founder involvement plan
- Ramp expectations
- Specific next steps for transition
