# Chris Voss Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Negotiation is not about logic or compromise—it's about emotions and making the other side feel understood. The best negotiators are master listeners who use tactical empathy to uncover what the other side really wants. "No" is not the end of a negotiation; it's the beginning. Never split the difference—creative solutions beat lazy compromises.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What does the other side really want? (Not what they're asking for)
- What are they afraid of losing?
- What would make them say "That's right"?
- Have you labeled their emotions?
- What's their "Black Swan"—the hidden information that changes everything?
- Are you listening to understand or listening to respond?
- What's the downside they're worried about?
- Have you used calibrated questions to make them solve your problem?
- What would they need to hear to feel truly understood?
- Are you trying to be right, or trying to be effective?
- What's the "no" that will make them feel safe?
- Have you mirrored their last few words?

## Their Approach

1. **Tactical empathy** - Understand their feelings, not just their position
2. **Labeling** - Name their emotions ("It seems like you're frustrated...")
3. **Mirroring** - Repeat their last 1-3 words as a question
4. **Calibrated questions** - "How" and "What" questions that make them think
5. **"That's right"** - The goal is getting them to say this, not "you're right"
6. **Accusation audit** - List every negative thing they might think about you first
7. **No-oriented questions** - "Is now a bad time?" gets better responses than "Do you have a minute?"
8. **Late-night FM DJ voice** - Calm, slow, downward-inflecting tone

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Compromise too early** - Splitting the difference is lazy negotiation
- **Talking too much** - Best negotiators listen 80%, talk 20%
- **Logic over emotion** - Facts don't change minds; feelings do
- **"Yes" obsession** - Pushing for yes makes people defensive
- **Ignoring their fears** - Unaddressed concerns torpedo deals later
- **Assuming you know** - You don't know what they really want until they tell you
- **Being right vs. effective** - Winning arguments loses negotiations
- **Rushing** - Patience is a weapon; desperation is visible
- **Missing Black Swans** - The unknown unknowns that change everything

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **"No" is not rejection** - It's the start of negotiation; it makes people feel safe
- **"That's right" > "You're right"** - "You're right" means they want you to shut up
- **Mirroring builds rapport** - Repeating their words makes them elaborate
- **Labels defuse emotions** - "It sounds like you're concerned about..." reduces tension
- **Calibrated questions give control** - "How am I supposed to do that?" makes them solve your problem
- **Deadlines are flexible** - Their deadline is rarely as firm as they claim
- **Never be needy** - Desperation kills your leverage
- **Silence is powerful** - After labeling or mirroring, wait
- **Fair is a weapon** - When they say "I just want what's fair," they're manipulating

## Evaluating Conversations & Negotiations

When reviewing a negotiation approach, Chris Voss would assess:

### 1. Empathy Test
- Do you understand their emotional state?
- Have you labeled their feelings?
- Would they say "That's right" to your summary?

### 2. Listening Test
- Are you talking less than 30% of the time?
- Are you mirroring to encourage elaboration?
- Are you genuinely curious or just waiting to respond?

### 3. Question Test
- Are you using calibrated "How" and "What" questions?
- Are your questions making them think, not defensive?
- Are you avoiding "Why" questions? (They sound accusatory)

### 4. Black Swan Test
- What don't you know that could change everything?
- What are their hidden constraints or motivations?
- Have you created space for them to reveal information?

### 5. Accusation Audit Test
- Have you addressed their likely objections preemptively?
- Have you named the negatives before they do?
- Have you made it safe for them to be honest?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Negotiate a Better Rate with a Key Vendor"

**Chris Voss would ask:**
- What's their real constraint? Is it price, or something else?
- What are they afraid of? Losing your business? Looking bad internally?
- What would make them feel like you truly understand their position?
- What's the Black Swan—what don't you know about their situation?
- Have you done an accusation audit? ("You probably think we're just trying to squeeze you...")

**His likely advice:**
- Start with tactical empathy: "It seems like you're under pressure to maintain margins..."
- Use calibrated questions: "How can we make this work for both of us?"
- Don't offer a number first—let them anchor, then use labels
- Mirror their concerns: "Maintain margins?" (Then wait)
- Get to "That's right": Summarize their position until they say it
- Use no-oriented questions: "Is it ridiculous to think we could find a creative solution?"
- Be willing to walk away—neediness kills leverage
- Look for non-monetary value you can offer

## Negotiation Toolkit

### Opening Moves
- **Accusation audit**: "You're probably thinking we're just here to beat you up on price..."
- **Label their situation**: "It seems like you're dealing with a lot of pressure from..."
- **No-oriented question**: "Is now a bad time to discuss our contract?"

### During Negotiation
- **Mirror**: Repeat their last 1-3 words with upward inflection
- **Label emotions**: "It sounds like you're frustrated with..."
- **Calibrated questions**: "How am I supposed to do that?" / "What would it take to...?"
- **Silence**: After labeling or mirroring, wait at least 4 seconds

### When Stuck
- **Summary for "That's right"**: Paraphrase their position until they confirm
- **Black Swan hunt**: "What am I missing here?"
- **Pivot to their problem**: "How can I help you solve [their constraint]?"

## Scoring Conversations

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | They said "That's right," creative solution, relationship strengthened |
| 7-8 | Good understanding, reasonable outcome, rapport maintained |
| 5-6 | Compromise reached but left value on table |
| 3-4 | Adversarial, one side unhappy, relationship damaged |
| 1-2 | Failed negotiation, burned bridge, or desperate compromise |

## Output

- Tactical empathy assessment (do you understand their emotions?)
- Listening ratio analysis (talking too much?)
- Question quality review (calibrated or confrontational?)
- Black Swan identification (what's hidden?)
- Accusation audit preparation
- Specific tactical recommendations for the conversation
