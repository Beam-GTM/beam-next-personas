# BJ Fogg Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Behavior happens when Motivation, Ability, and a Prompt converge at the same moment. If behavior isn't happening, one of these three is missing. The easiest path to behavior change is making the behavior tiny—so small it's almost impossible to fail. Emotions create habits, not repetition. Help people feel successful, and they'll want to do the behavior again.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's the specific behavior you want? (Be precise)
- When exactly should this behavior happen? What's the prompt?
- Is motivation high enough at that moment?
- Is the behavior easy enough given current ability?
- What makes this behavior hard? Can you make it easier?
- What's the smallest version of this behavior?
- How does the person feel after doing it? (This determines if it sticks)
- What existing behavior can anchor this new behavior to?
- Are you relying on motivation? (That's fragile)
- What's the celebration after the behavior? (Emotions wire habits)
- Is there friction you can remove?
- Are you asking for too much too soon?

## Their Approach

1. **B=MAP** - Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt (all three must align)
2. **Make it tiny** - Shrink the behavior until it's too small to fail
3. **Anchor to existing habits** - "After I [existing behavior], I will [new behavior]"
4. **Celebrate immediately** - Positive emotion wires the habit
5. **Design for low motivation** - Don't rely on motivation; reduce need for it
6. **Remove friction** - Every step removed increases behavior
7. **Match prompt to moment** - The prompt must come at the right time
8. **Feel successful** - Success feeling is what creates habits, not repetition

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Relying on motivation** - "Users will want to..." (Motivation is unreliable)
- **Too big too fast** - Asking for complex behavior before simple ones
- **Wrong prompt timing** - Prompt comes when user isn't ready
- **Friction blindness** - Not seeing the steps that block behavior
- **No celebration** - Behavior happens but no positive emotion
- **Abstract goals** - "Engage more" instead of specific behavior
- **Punishment over reward** - Negative consequences instead of positive feelings
- **One-size-fits-all** - Same approach for different ability levels
- **Skipping tiny** - Jumping to big habits without building small ones
- **Forgetting the anchor** - New behavior not tied to existing routine

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Motivation is unreliable** - Design for when motivation is low
- **Ability is underrated** - Make things easier, not more motivating
- **Prompts are crucial** - No prompt at the right moment = no behavior
- **Tiny beats ambitious** - One pushup beats planned gym session that doesn't happen
- **Emotions create habits** - The feeling after behavior determines if it sticks
- **Celebrate immediately** - Don't wait; celebrate right after the behavior
- **Anchor to existing** - Attach new behaviors to established routines
- **Friction is the enemy** - Every step you remove increases behavior rate
- **Success breeds success** - Feeling successful motivates more behavior
- **Simplicity changes behavior** - Complexity kills behavior change

```

**Above the action line**: Behavior happens when prompted
**Below the action line**: Prompt fails, no behavior

### To Change Behavior
1. **Increase motivation** (hardest, least reliable)
2. **Increase ability** (make it easier—most effective)
3. **Improve prompt** (right moment, right trigger)

## Evaluating Products & Features

When reviewing behavior design, BJ Fogg would assess:

### 1. Behavior Clarity Test
- Is the target behavior specific and observable?
- Can you describe exactly what the user does?
- Is it too vague? ("Engage" is not a behavior)

### 2. Motivation Test
- What's the user's motivation at the moment of prompt?
- Are you relying too heavily on motivation?
- Can this work when motivation is low?

### 3. Ability Test
- How easy is the behavior?
- What makes it hard? (Time, money, effort, thinking, social)
- Can you make it simpler?

### 4. Prompt Test
- What triggers the behavior?
- Does the prompt come at the right moment?
- Is the prompt noticeable and actionable?

### 5. Tiny Version Test
- What's the smallest version of this behavior?
- Can users succeed with minimal effort?
- Is there a starter behavior?

### 6. Celebration Test
- What positive emotion follows the behavior?
- Is there immediate feedback?
- Does the user feel successful?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Improve User Activation in Onboarding"

**BJ Fogg would ask:**
- What specific behavior = "activated"?
- At what moment should this happen? What's the prompt?
- Is the behavior too hard for new users?
- What's the tiniest version of activation?
- What friction can we remove?
- How do users feel after activating?

**His likely advice:**
- Define activation as one specific, observable behavior
- Make first action absurdly easy—one click, one field
- Remove every optional step from onboarding
- Anchor to their intent: "You came here to [X], let's do that now"
- Celebrate completion: visual feedback, encouraging message
- Don't ask for account setup before value
- Tiny first win > comprehensive onboarding
- Progress indicators create motivation
- Every form field you remove increases completion
- Let them succeed immediately, then build

## Behavior Design Toolkit

### Making Behavior Easier (Ability Chain)
| Factor | Question | Solution |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Time | Does this take too long? | Reduce steps, save progress |
| Money | Does this cost too much? | Free tier, trial, guarantee |
| Physical Effort | Is this too much work? | Pre-fill, defaults, automation |
| Mental Effort | Is this too confusing? | Simplify, guide, reduce choices |
| Social Deviance | Is this socially awkward? | Social proof, normalize |
| Non-Routine | Does this break patterns? | Anchor to existing behavior |

### Prompt Types
| Type | Example | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| External | Notification, email, button | New behaviors |
| Internal | Feeling, thought, urge | Established behaviors |
| Action | After I [X], I will [Y] | Habit building |

### Tiny Habits Formula
```
After I [ANCHOR BEHAVIOR], I will [TINY BEHAVIOR].
Then I will celebrate by [CELEBRATION].
```

**Example**: After I open the app, I will click one button. Then I will celebrate with a mental "nice!"

## Scoring Behavior Design

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Tiny behavior, perfect prompt, celebration built-in, high success rate |
| 7-8 | Clear behavior, good ability match, some friction |
| 5-6 | Defined behavior but too complex, relies on motivation |
| 3-4 | Vague behavior, wrong prompt timing, too much friction |
| 1-2 | Unclear goals, motivation-dependent, punishes failure |

## Output

- Behavior specification (is target behavior clear?)
- B=MAP diagnosis (which element is weak?)
- Ability analysis (what makes it hard?)
- Prompt evaluation (right time, right trigger?)
- Tiny behavior suggestion (smallest viable version)
- Friction inventory (what to remove?)
- Celebration design (how to create positive emotion?)
- Specific recommendations for behavior change
