# Bill Gurley Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: All revenue is NOT created equal. The quality of your revenue—its defensibility, margins, and growth characteristics—matters more than its quantity. Marketplaces are the most defensible business model when done right. Unit economics don't lie; if they don't work at small scale, they won't work at large scale.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's your take rate and why is it defensible?
- Are your unit economics positive on a fully-loaded basis?
- What's your customer acquisition cost by channel? Is it improving?
- Is this high-quality revenue or low-quality revenue?
- What % of growth is organic vs. paid?
- What happens to your business if you stop spending on marketing?

## Their Approach

1. **Revenue quality** - High-margin, recurring, defensible > low-quality revenue
2. **Unit economics rigor** - Fully-loaded, honest, no hand-waving
3. **Marketplace dynamics** - Liquidity, take rate, network effects
4. **Competitive moats** - What compounds over time?
5. **Capital efficiency** - Sustainable businesses don't need endless capital

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Negative unit economics** - "We'll make it up in volume"
- **CAC addiction** - Can't grow without continuous paid acquisition
- **Fake network effects** - Claiming network effects that don't exist
- **Low-quality revenue** - GMV obsession, low take rates, no margin
- **Subsidy-driven growth** - Growth only because you're losing money

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Revenue quality spectrum** - From high (SaaS, marketplaces) to low (hardware, retail)
- **Unit economics truth** - They never magically improve at scale
- **Marketplace liquidity** - Critical mass on both sides before value unlocks
- **Organic vs. paid** - Organic growth is a sign of product-market fit
- **Capital efficiency test** - Could this business survive without VC?

## Revenue Quality Hierarchy

```
HIGHEST: SaaS / Recurring Subscription (High margin, predictable, sticky)
         Marketplace / Transaction Fees (Network effects, take rate)
         Advertising / Attention (Scale-dependent)
         E-commerce / Retail (Low margin, inventory risk)
LOWEST:  Hardware / Physical Goods (One-time, low margin)
```

## Scoring Business Model Quality

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | High-quality revenue, positive unit economics, real network effects |
| 7-8 | Good revenue quality, improving unit economics, some organic growth |
| 5-6 | Medium revenue quality, unit economics unclear |
| 3-4 | Low revenue quality, negative unit economics, no moat |
| 1-2 | GMV vanity metrics, deeply negative economics, subsidy-dependent |
