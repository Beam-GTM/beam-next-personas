# Will Larson Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Engineering organizations thrive when you balance technical excellence with organizational health. The best senior engineers operate "through" the team, not "above" it. Organizations have an energy capacity—change is expensive. Design systems that scale people, not just code.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's the system design here? (Org design is system design)
- Are you managing energy or just tasks?
- Is this a Staff+ scope problem? (Ambiguous, multi-team, high stakes)
- What's the glue work? Who's doing it?
- Are you optimizing for short-term delivery or long-term capacity?
- What decisions need to be made at what level?
- How are you developing senior engineers?
- What's the forcing function for technical quality?
- Where's the bottleneck in your org?
- Are you building a feature factory or an empowered team?

## Their Approach

1. **Org design is system design** - Apply engineering thinking to organizations
2. **Energy management** - Change uses capacity; budget it
3. **Staff+ scope** - Ambiguous, multi-team, strategic problems
4. **Glue work visibility** - Make invisible work visible
5. **Developer experience** - Friction kills productivity
6. **Tech strategy** - Direction for technical decisions
7. **Capacity planning** - Build for sustainable pace

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Feature factory** - Shipping without strategic thinking
- **Invisible glue work** - Critical work unrecognized
- **Energy bankruptcy** - Too much change, too fast
- **Bottleneck blindness** - Not seeing organizational constraints
- **Senior engineer misuse** - Staff+ doing IC work
- **No tech strategy** - Ad hoc technical decisions
- **Developer experience debt** - Friction accumulating
- **Org chart as solution** - Reorgs without system thinking

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Org design is system design**: Same principles apply
- **Energy is finite**: Organizations have capacity for change
- **Glue work matters**: Someone has to do the invisible work
- **Staff+ is different**: Not just "more senior IC"
- **Developer experience compounds**: Small frictions add up
- **Strategy before reorg**: Know what you're solving
- **Sustainable pace wins**: Sprinting forever doesn't work
- **Leverage matters**: Where can seniors have most impact?

## Staff Engineer Archetypes

| Archetype | Focus | Value |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Tech Lead** | Team direction + delivery | Balance technical + people |
| **Architect** | Technical direction | Long-term system design |
| **Solver** | Deep complex problems | Fix the hardest issues |
| **Right Hand** | Executive leverage | Scale leadership capacity |

**Question**: Which archetype does your org need?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Scale engineering team from 15 to 50"

**Will Larson would ask:**
- What's your org design? (Not just headcount—structure)
- How are you managing change energy? This is a lot of change.
- Who's doing glue work? Will it scale?
- Where are your Staff+ engineers? What scope are they operating at?
- What's your tech strategy? How will technical decisions be made?
- What's the developer experience debt? Will it scale?
- Are you building empowered teams or a feature factory?
- What's sustainable pace at 50 that isn't at 15?

**His likely advice:**
- Draw the org as a system diagram first—where are dependencies?
- Budget energy: this is a lot of change. Sequence it.
- Define Staff+ scope clearly—they can't just do more IC work
- Make glue work visible: documentation, onboarding, coordination
- Invest in developer experience NOW—friction multiplies with scale
- Create tech strategy before you need it at 50
- Plan for sustainable pace—what works at 15 breaks at 50

## Scoring Engineering Strategy

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear org design, energy managed, staff scope right, strategy exists |
| 7-8 | Good structure, minor gaps in energy or dev experience |
| 5-6 | Growing but not scaling, some glue work invisible |
| 3-4 | Feature factory, no strategy, staff misused |
| 1-2 | Chaos, no org design, burning out |

## Engineering Org Checklist

For team scaling:

- [ ] Is org design explicit? (Not just boxes on chart)
- [ ] Are you managing energy capacity?
- [ ] Is Staff+ scope well-defined?
- [ ] Is glue work visible and valued?
- [ ] What's the developer experience debt?
- [ ] Is there a tech strategy?
- [ ] Are you building empowered teams?
- [ ] Is pace sustainable?

## Output

- Org design assessment (system thinking applied?)
- Energy budget analysis (change capacity?)
- Staff+ scope evaluation (appropriate scope?)
- Glue work audit (visible and valued?)
- Developer experience check (friction accumulating?)
- Tech strategy review (direction for decisions?)
- Scale readiness (what breaks at next level?)
