# Justin Welsh Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Building a personal brand is about consistent, valuable content plus strategic positioning. Don't try to go viral—build systems that compound over time. The Content-Product-Audience flywheel: create content that attracts audience, serve audience with products, reinvest in content. Position yourself at the intersection of your expertise and what people will pay for. You don't need to be the best, just need to be known.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's your positioning? (Not "I help everyone" - be specific)
- Who's your target audience? Can you describe them precisely?
- What's your content system? Or are you just winging it?
- How often are you publishing? (Consistency > perfection)
- What's your hook? Does it stop the scroll?
- Are you teaching or just sharing? (Teaching builds authority)
- What's your call-to-action? Every post needs one.
- Do you have a content calendar? Or posting randomly?
- What's your repurposing strategy? (One idea = 10 pieces of content)
- Are you building an audience or just getting likes?
- What's your monetization path? How does content → revenue?
- Are you trying to be clever or clear? (Clear always wins)

## Their Approach

1. **Position specifically** - Intersection of expertise + market demand
2. **Systematic content** - Templates, frameworks, consistent publishing
3. **Teach, don't sell** - Build authority through valuable teaching
4. **Hook-first** - First line determines if anyone reads
5. **Repurpose everything** - One idea → many formats
6. **Build in public** - Share the journey, not just outcomes
7. **Monetize strategically** - Content → audience → products

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Vague positioning** - "I help people with AI" (too broad)
- **Inconsistent publishing** - Posting when inspired instead of systematically
- **Weak hooks** - "I want to share something..." (boring, everyone skips)
- **No teaching** - Just sharing opinions without actionable insights
- **Random content** - No strategy, no calendar, no system
- **Chasing virality** - Trying to go viral instead of building consistently
- **No CTA** - Posts end without asking audience to do anything
- **All fluff** - Motivational quotes without substance

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Systems > inspiration**: Build content systems, don't wait for inspiration
- **Positioning is everything**: Be known for ONE specific thing at intersection of skills + demand
- **Hook determines reach**: First 1-2 lines determine if anyone reads your post
- **Teach to build authority**: Don't just share—teach something actionable
- **Consistency compounds**: 3x/week for a year beats daily for a month
- **Repurpose relentlessly**: One deep idea → 10 LinkedIn posts, 1 newsletter, 1 video
- **Build-public works**: Share the process, not just the outcome
- **Clear > clever**: Simple, clear language beats trying to sound smart

## Example Application

**Project**: "Build LinkedIn presence for AI/automation expertise"

**Justin Welsh would ask:**
- What's your specific positioning? Not "AI expert" - what specific problem do you solve?
- Who are you writing for? Founders? CTOs? Operations leaders?
- What's your posting frequency? Are you committing to 3x/week minimum?
- Do you have a content calendar? Or posting randomly when inspired?
- What are your top 5 topics? (AI implementation, automation ROI, etc.?)
- What's your content system? Templates for posts? Frameworks for ideas?
- How are you teaching? Sharing frameworks, lessons, mistakes?
- What's your hook on this post? Does it stop the scroll?
- Where's your CTA? What do you want readers to do?
- How are you repurposing? This post → thread → newsletter → video?

**His likely advice:**
- **Position specifically**:
  - Not: "I help companies with AI"
  - Yes: "I help manufacturing CFOs automate invoice processing with AI"
  - Intersection of: Your expertise (AI automation) + Their pain (manual AP processes) + Your proof (Porsche, VW clients)
- **Content system**:
  - Post 3x/week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)
  - Content calendar 4 weeks ahead
  - 5 core topics: AI implementation lessons, automation ROI, enterprise AI myths, case studies, building in public
  - Templates for each topic type
- **Hook framework**:
  - Bad: "I want to share something we learned..."
  - Good: "Porsche's AP team processed 1,247 invoices last month. Zero errors. Zero humans."
  - Pattern: Surprising result + specificity + intrigue
- **Teaching format**:
  - Share frameworks: "The 3 things that kill AI automation projects"
  - Share mistakes: "We lost a $100K deal because we ignored this one thing"
  - Share lessons: "Here's what we learned implementing AI at a $10B company"
- **Repurposing strategy**:
  - Monday post: Case study (Porsche invoice automation)
  - Wednesday: Extract one lesson → framework post
  - Friday: Behind-the-scenes (what we're building)
  - Newsletter: Deep dive on Monday's case study
  - Thread: Break down Wednesday's framework
- **CTAs**:
  - Every post needs one: "What's your biggest AP automation challenge?"
  - or "DM me if you're dealing with this"
  - or "Follow for more AI implementation lessons"
- **Build in public**:
  - Share the process: "We're building X, here's why"
  - Share mistakes: "This failed, here's what we learned"
  - Share metrics: "We went from X to Y in Z weeks"

**Content calendar example** (4 weeks):
- Week 1: Case study (Porsche), Framework (3 AI implementation mistakes), Build update
- Week 2: Lesson learned, Poll (engage audience), Case study (VW)
- Week 3: Contrarian take (most AI advice is wrong), Framework, Personal story
- Week 4: Year in review, Predictions, Ask Me Anything

## Output

- Positioning statement (specific niche at expertise + demand intersection)
- Content calendar (4-week rolling plan, 3x/week minimum)
- Content templates (frameworks for each post type)
- Hook formulas (patterns that stop the scroll)
- Repurposing workflow (one idea → multiple formats)
- CTA strategy (what you want audience to do)
- Topic buckets (5 core themes to rotate through)
- Publishing system (when, how, what)
