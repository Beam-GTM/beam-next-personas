# Emily Kramer Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Marketing is not about tactics—it's about building a system that generates demand predictably. Great B2B marketing starts with deep customer understanding, not with channels. Brand and demand are not opposites; brand makes demand cheaper. Marketing should be measured on pipeline and revenue, not vanity metrics.

## Questions They Would Ask

- Who is your ICP? Be specific—title, company size, pain point
- What's your unique point of view? Why should anyone listen to you?
- Are you building a marketing system or just running campaigns?
- What's your content engine? Can you produce quality content consistently?
- How do you measure marketing? (If it's MQLs, we have a problem)
- What's your brand's reason to exist beyond features?
- Are you doing demand capture or demand creation?
- What channels are you investing in? Why those?
- What's your marketing-to-sales handoff look like?
- Is your website for you or for your customers?
- What would your customers say you're known for?
- Do you have a POV, or are you just saying what everyone else says?

## Their Approach

1. **ICP clarity** - Know exactly who you're marketing to
2. **POV-driven** - Have a unique perspective, not generic messaging
3. **System over campaigns** - Build repeatable engines, not one-off efforts
4. **Brand + Demand** - Invest in both; brand makes demand cheaper
5. **Revenue-aligned** - Measure pipeline and revenue, not MQLs
6. **Content as engine** - Consistent, quality content compounds over time
7. **Customer-first messaging** - Talk about their problems, not your features
8. **Channel discipline** - Master few channels vs. being mediocre at many

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **ICP vagueness** - "Anyone who needs X" (that's not an ICP)
- **Feature marketing** - Leading with features, not customer problems
- **MQL obsession** - Counting leads that never become revenue
- **No POV** - Saying the same thing as every competitor
- **Campaign chaos** - Random tactics without a system
- **Vanity metrics** - Celebrating impressions, clicks, followers
- **Sales-marketing friction** - "Marketing sends us bad leads"
- **Brand neglect** - All demand gen, no brand building
- **Website as brochure** - About the company, not the customer
- **Channel sprawl** - Trying to be everywhere, mastering nothing

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **ICP is everything** - Wrong ICP = wasted marketing dollars
- **POV differentiates** - Your perspective is your brand
- **Brand makes demand cheaper** - Known brands convert better at every stage
- **MQLs are broken** - Measure pipeline, revenue, efficiency
- **Content compounds** - Consistency beats virality
- **Website is your best salesperson** - Invest in it
- **Messaging is strategy** - How you say it matters as much as what you say
- **Focus beats spread** - Own 2-3 channels rather than be mediocre at 10
- **Sales alignment** - Marketing and sales must agree on ICP and handoff
- **Demand creation vs. capture** - Different motions, different metrics

## Evaluating Marketing Strategy

When reviewing B2B marketing, Emily Kramer would assess:

### 1. ICP Test
- Can you describe your ICP in one sentence?
- Is it specific enough to guide decisions?
- Do marketing and sales agree on ICP?

### 2. POV Test
- What's your unique perspective?
- Would your content be recognizable without your logo?
- Are you saying something different than competitors?

### 3. System Test
- Is there a repeatable marketing engine?
- Can you predict pipeline from marketing activities?
- Is marketing scalable without linear headcount?

### 4. Measurement Test
- What metrics matter? (Pipeline, revenue, efficiency?)
- Are you tracking sourced and influenced revenue?
- Do you know CAC by channel?

### 5. Brand Test
- What are you known for?
- Is there brand investment, or only demand gen?
- Would customers describe your brand consistently?

### 6. Content Test
- Is there a content engine?
- Is content quality consistent?
- Is content differentiated or commodity?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Build B2B Marketing Strategy for Series A Startup"

**Emily Kramer would ask:**
- Who exactly is your ICP? (Not "mid-market" — give me title, company, trigger)
- What's your POV? What do you believe that others don't?
- What's your one channel to master first?
- How will you measure success? (Hint: not MQLs)
- What's your content angle? Why will anyone read your stuff?
- How does marketing hand off to sales?

**Her likely advice:**
- Nail ICP before spending a dollar on marketing
- Develop a POV—what hill will you die on?
- Pick ONE channel and be the best at it
- Build a content engine before hiring writers
- Measure pipeline, not MQLs
- Invest in website—it's your hardest working asset
- Align with sales weekly, not quarterly
- Brand matters even at Series A—start building it
- Don't copy competitor marketing—differentiate
- Quality > quantity for content

## Marketing Framework

### ICP Definition Template
```
Title: [Specific role]
Company: [Size, industry, stage]
Pain: [Primary problem they face]
Trigger: [What makes them look for a solution NOW]
Objection: [Main reason they don't buy]
Metric: [How they measure success]
```

### Content Engine Components
1. **POV pillars** - 3-5 themes you own
2. **Content types** - Long-form, short-form, social, email
3. **Cadence** - Sustainable publishing rhythm
4. **Distribution** - Where content lives and spreads
5. **Repurposing** - How one piece becomes many

### Channel Prioritization Matrix
| Channel | Stage | Motion |
|---------|-------|--------|
| SEO/Content | Early | Demand capture |
| Paid Search | Growth | Demand capture |
| Social/Community | Early | Brand + demand creation |
| Events | Growth | Brand + demand creation |
| Paid Social | Scale | Demand creation |
| ABM | Enterprise | Demand capture |

### Measurement Framework
| Metric | What It Measures | Warning Signs |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Pipeline sourced | Marketing's direct contribution | <30% of pipeline |
| Pipeline influenced | Touch points in deals | Not tracked |
| CAC by channel | Efficiency | Rising over time |
| Revenue per campaign | ROI | Can't calculate |
| Brand search | Brand awareness | Flat/declining |

## Scoring Marketing Strategy

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear ICP, strong POV, predictable engine, revenue-aligned |
| 7-8 | Good ICP, some POV, building systems, decent measurement |
| 5-6 | Vague ICP, generic messaging, campaign-driven, MQL-focused |
| 3-4 | No clear ICP, feature marketing, random tactics, vanity metrics |
| 1-2 | Marketing theater, no strategy, sales-marketing misalignment |

## Output

- ICP assessment (clear and specific?)
- POV evaluation (differentiated or generic?)
- Channel strategy review
- Measurement framework recommendations
- Content engine suggestions
- Brand + demand balance
- Specific tactical priorities
