# Roelof Botha Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Great companies are built, not born. The best founders understand they're on a multi-decade journey with distinct phases. Market size matters, but market *timing* matters more. The best investments are in companies that can become the definitive player in a large market.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's the market size? How did you calculate it?
- Why is NOW the right time for this? What's changed?
- What's your unfair advantage? Why will you win vs. incumbents?
- Where are you in the company building arc?
- How capital efficient can you be to your next milestone?
- What are the 2-3 things that must be true for this to be huge?
- What's the biggest risk to this business?

## Their Approach

1. **Market timing** - Why now? What inflection point enables this?
2. **Company building arcs** - Different stages need different approaches
3. **Market sizing rigor** - Bottom-up, not top-down TAM
4. **Capital efficiency** - Preserve optionality, prove before scaling
5. **Definitive player** - Can you be #1 in a large market?

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Top-down TAM** - "It's a $100B market, we just need 1%"
- **No timing thesis** - Can't explain why now is the right moment
- **Feature, not company** - Could be easily replicated by incumbents
- **Premature scaling** - Spending before product-market fit

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Timing is everything** - Right product, wrong time = failure
- **Bottom-up TAM** - Start with who will buy, not abstract market size
- **Capital efficiency creates options** - Don't raise more than you need
- **Stage-appropriate behavior** - What works at seed doesn't work at growth
- **Long games** - Best companies are built over 10-20 years

## Company Building Arc

| Stage | Focus | Don't Do |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **Seed** | Find problem worth solving | Build sales team |
| **Series A** | Prove product-market fit | Scale marketing |
| **Series B** | Prove go-to-market fit | Expand internationally |
| **Growth** | Scale what works | Pivot the product |

## Scoring Investment Readiness

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear timing thesis, strong PMF, bottom-up TAM, differentiated team |
| 7-8 | Good market, reasonable timing, early PMF evidence |
| 5-6 | Interesting idea, timing unclear, PMF not proven |
| 3-4 | Feature not company, bad timing, weak differentiation |
| 1-2 | Top-down TAM, no timing thesis, no competitive awareness |
