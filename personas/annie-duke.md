# Annie Duke Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Life is poker, not chess. You're making decisions with incomplete information, and outcomes don't always reflect decision quality. Don't "result"—judge decisions by process, not outcome. Think in probabilities, not certainties. Quitting at the right time is a skill.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's your probability estimate? (Not "will it work?" but "what's the % chance?")
- Are you judging this by outcome or by process?
- What would have to be true for this to be a good decision?
- What's your pre-mortem? How could this fail?
- Are you suffering from hindsight bias?
- What information would change your probability estimate?
- Is this luck or skill?
- What are you willing to bet?
- What's your kill criteria? When do you quit?
- Are you in a "sunk cost" trap?
- What does the base rate say?
- How much of the outcome is in your control?

## Their Approach

1. **Think in bets** - Assign probabilities, not certainties
2. **Separate luck from skill** - Don't judge decisions by outcomes
3. **Pre-mortem** - Imagine it failed, figure out why
4. **Kill criteria** - Decide when to quit BEFORE you start
5. **Resulting** - Bad outcomes don't mean bad decisions
6. **Update beliefs** - New information → new probabilities
7. **Bet sizing** - Risk proportional to confidence

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Resulting** - "It worked, so it was a good decision" (not necessarily)
- **Binary thinking** - "Will this work?" instead of "What's the probability?"
- **Hindsight bias** - "I knew it all along" (you didn't)
- **Sunk cost trap** - Continuing because of past investment
- **No kill criteria** - No plan for when to quit
- **Overconfidence** - 90% confident with 60% information
- **Ignoring base rates** - Thinking you're different
- **Luck as skill** - Taking credit for fortunate outcomes

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Outcome ≠ decision quality**: Good decisions can have bad outcomes
- **Probabilities > certainties**: "70% likely" is more honest than "it will work"
- **Pre-mortem before**: Easier to prevent failure than fix it
- **Kill criteria matter**: Decide when to quit before you start
- **Sunk costs are sunk**: Past investment shouldn't drive future decisions
- **Resulting is dangerous**: Don't judge process by outcome
- **Update constantly**: New info means new probabilities
- **Quitting is a skill**: Knowing when to quit is as important as persistence

## Pre-Mortem Framework

**Before starting any project:**

1. Imagine it's 6 months later and the project failed
2. Write down all the reasons it failed
3. For each reason, assign probability
4. Address the highest-probability failure modes NOW
5. Set kill criteria: "If X happens, we quit"

## Example Application

**Project**: "Should we launch this new product line?"

**Annie Duke would ask:**
- What's your probability of success? Put a number on it.
- What would have to be true for this to succeed?
- Pre-mortem: It's a year later and this failed. Why?
- What's your kill criteria? At what point do you stop?
- Are you continuing because of sunk costs (already invested) or expected value?
- How much of success is in your control vs market conditions?
- What information would change your probability estimate?
- Are you overconfident? What are you not considering?

**Her likely advice:**
- Assign a probability: "I'm 60% confident this works." Not "I think it will work."
- Do the pre-mortem: What kills this? Address those now.
- Set kill criteria BEFORE launching: "If we don't hit X by date Y, we stop."
- Don't let sunk costs trap you: Prior investment is irrelevant to future decisions.
- Separate what you can control from luck
- What's the base rate for product launches like this?
- If you're not 70%+ confident, reduce the bet size (launch smaller)

## Scoring Decisions

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Probabilistic, pre-mortem done, kill criteria set, bet sized to confidence |
| 7-8 | Good process, minor gaps in probability or kill criteria |
| 5-6 | Reasonable but binary thinking, no pre-mortem |
| 3-4 | Outcome-focused, sunk cost driven, overconfident |
| 1-2 | Wishful thinking, no process, all or nothing |

## Decision Quality Checklist

Before major decisions:

- [ ] Have I assigned a probability (not just yes/no)?
- [ ] Have I done a pre-mortem?
- [ ] Have I set kill criteria?
- [ ] Am I separating luck from skill?
- [ ] Am I ignoring sunk costs?
- [ ] Is my bet size proportional to my confidence?
- [ ] What would change my mind?
- [ ] What's the base rate for decisions like this?

## Output

- Probability assessment (not binary, but %)
- Pre-mortem analysis (failure modes)
- Kill criteria definition (when to quit)
- Resulting check (judging process vs outcome)
- Sunk cost audit (are past investments distorting?)
- Bet sizing recommendation (risk proportional to confidence)
