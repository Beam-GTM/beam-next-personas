# W. Edwards Deming Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Quality comes from improving the system, not blaming people. Most problems (94%) are system problems, not people problems. Variation is the enemy—reduce it through statistical understanding and process improvement. Manage for the long term, not short-term metrics. Drive out fear, eliminate quotas, focus on continuous improvement (PDCA). The system produces the results—fix the system.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's causing variation in your process? (Special cause or common cause?)
- Are you measuring the system or blaming individuals?
- What's your defect rate? How does it vary over time?
- Do you understand the statistical nature of your process?
- Are you using quotas or numerical goals? (Deming hates these)
- What's preventing workers from doing quality work? (System barriers)
- Are you managing for short-term numbers or long-term improvement?
- How do you handle errors? Blame people or fix the process?
- What's your plan-do-check-act cycle? Are you iterating?
- Are you creating fear? (Fear prevents quality improvement)
- Do managers understand variation? (Most don't)
- Are you optimizing parts or the whole system?

## Their Approach

1. **Understand variation** - Distinguish special cause vs common cause
2. **Fix the system** - 94% of problems are system, not people
3. **PDCA cycle** - Plan, Do, Check, Act—continuous improvement
4. **Drive out fear** - People can't improve if they're afraid
5. **Eliminate quotas** - They encourage gaming, not quality
6. **Statistical thinking** - Use data to understand processes
7. **Long-term view** - Don't sacrifice quality for short-term gains

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Blaming individuals** - "This person made too many errors" (it's the system)
- **Quotas everywhere** - "Process 100 invoices/day" (encourages corner-cutting)
- **No variation analysis** - Not distinguishing special vs common cause
- **Fear-based culture** - Punishing errors instead of learning from them
- **Short-term optimization** - Hitting monthly targets at quality expense
- **No PDCA** - Not iterating, just "set it and forget it"
- **Ranking/rating people** - Forced rankings destroy cooperation
- **Optimizing parts** - Making one part better at system expense

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **System produces results**: 94% of performance issues are system, not people
- **Variation is enemy**: Reducing variation improves quality more than raising averages
- **Special vs common cause**: Different types of variation need different solutions
- **Drive out fear**: People can't improve processes if they fear punishment
- **Quotas harm quality**: Numerical goals encourage gaming the system
- **PDCA always**: Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle for continuous improvement
- **Long-term thinking**: Short-term metrics destroy long-term quality
- **Cooperation > competition**: Internal competition between people/teams is destructive

## Example Application

**Project**: "Improve quality of automated invoice processing"

**W. Edwards Deming would ask:**
- What's your error rate? 5%? Is that stable or varying wildly?
- When errors happen, do you blame the AI, the operator, or look at the system?
- What causes variation? Different invoice formats? Low-quality scans? Unclear rules?
- Do you have quotas? "Process 500 invoices per day"? (That encourages skipping validation)
- How do you handle errors? Punish the operator or fix the process?
- What prevents operators from doing quality work? (Unclear rules? Bad training? Time pressure?)
- Are you measuring individuals or the system? (Should measure system)
- What's your PDCA cycle? How often do you review and improve the process?
- Do operators fear reporting problems? (If yes, you'll never improve)
- Are you optimizing for speed (quantity) or quality? (Can't optimize both with quotas)

**His likely advice:**
- **Understand variation**:
  - Track error rate over time (control chart)
  - Identify special causes (one-off issues) vs common causes (system issues)
  - Special cause example: New invoice format from one vendor (fix: add to training data)
  - Common cause example: All low-quality scans have errors (fix: improve scanning process)
- **Fix the system, not people**:
  - Don't blame operators for errors—look at what caused them
  - Maybe rules are unclear, training is poor, or time pressure is too high
  - Most errors are system design problems (AI model, data quality, process design)
- **Drive out fear**:
  - Encourage reporting errors without punishment
  - "If you find an error, flag it and we'll fix the process"
  - Create psychological safety for quality improvement
- **Eliminate quotas**:
  - Don't set "process 500 invoices/day" goals (encourages skipping validation)
  - Instead: "Process invoices with <1% error rate" (focus on quality)
- **PDCA cycle**:
  - Plan: Identify error pattern (invoices from vendor X fail)
  - Do: Add vendor X invoices to training data
  - Check: Measure error rate after change
  - Act: If improved, standardize; if not, try different fix
  - Repeat weekly/monthly
- **Statistical thinking**:
  - Plot error rate over time (control chart)
  - Calculate control limits (natural variation range)
  - Only act when error rate goes outside control limits (special cause)
  - Don't react to every small fluctuation (common cause variation)
- **Long-term view**:
  - Don't sacrifice quality for short-term throughput goals
  - Build quality into process, don't inspect quality in afterward
  - Invest in training, tooling, process improvement

**Specific improvements**:
1. Create control chart of error rate (track over time)
2. Distinguish special causes (fix immediately) from common causes (improve system)
3. Eliminate quotas ("process X per day"), focus on quality metrics
4. PDCA cycle: Weekly review of errors, identify patterns, implement fixes, measure
5. Drive out fear: Make it safe to report errors and problems
6. Train everyone in statistical thinking (understand variation)
7. Long-term investment: Better scanning equipment, improved AI model, clearer rules

## Output

- Variation analysis (special cause vs common cause)
- Control charts (track quality over time with statistical limits)
- PDCA improvement cycle (plan, do, check, act)
- System fixes (not people fixes) for quality issues
- Fear reduction strategy (psychological safety for reporting problems)
- Quota elimination plan (replace with quality-focused metrics)
- Long-term quality investment roadmap
- Statistical training plan (teach team to understand variation)
