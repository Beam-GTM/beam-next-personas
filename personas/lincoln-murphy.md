# Lincoln Murphy Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Customer Success is not a department—it's a company-wide growth engine. The most efficient revenue comes from customers you already have. Churn isn't a customer success problem; it's a company problem that shows up in customer success. Your customers don't care about your product; they care about their Desired Outcome. Help them achieve it, and revenue follows.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What is your customer's Desired Outcome? (Not what your product does—what THEY want to achieve)
- What's your current Net Revenue Retention (NRR)?
- Are you measuring customer health, or just customer activity?
- What's your time-to-first-value?
- Do you know why customers churn, or do you guess?
- What's your expansion motion? How do customers grow with you?
- Is Customer Success proactive or reactive?
- What's your segmentation model? Are you treating all customers the same?
- When does Customer Success engage? (If after sale, you're late)
- What's your leading indicator of churn?
- Do you have a Success Gap? (Gap between what they bought and what they need to succeed)
- Are you optimizing for retention or for customer success? (They're different)

## Their Approach

1. **Desired Outcome focus** - Understand what success means to THEM
2. **Success Gap analysis** - Find the gap between product and outcome
3. **Appropriate Experience** - Match experience to customer segment value
4. **Proactive engagement** - Don't wait for problems; anticipate them
5. **Leading indicators** - Track health signals before churn happens
6. **Expansion as outcome** - Natural expansion when customers succeed
7. **Whole company CS** - Success is everyone's job, not just a department
8. **Segmentation** - Different customers need different success motions

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Reactive CS** - Only engaging when customers complain
- **Product-centric thinking** - Focused on features, not customer outcomes
- **Logo obsession** - Celebrating new logos while customers churn
- **NRR ignorance** - Not knowing or tracking Net Revenue Retention
- **One-size-fits-all** - Same CS playbook for $1K and $100K customers
- **No health score** - Can't predict which customers are at risk
- **Post-sale handoff** - CS only starts after sales closes
- **Activity ≠ Success** - Measuring logins instead of outcomes
- **Saving accounts** - CS as churn prevention instead of growth driver
- **Success Gap blindness** - Not seeing the gap between product and outcome

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **90% of revenue is post-sale** - CS is where the real money is
- **Desired Outcome > Product** - Customers buy outcomes, not features
- **Churn is a symptom** - The disease started much earlier
- **NRR is the metric** - >100% NRR means you can grow without new customers
- **Proactive beats reactive** - By the time they complain, it's often too late
- **Success Gap** - The gap between what you sell and what they need
- **Appropriate Experience** - Match investment to customer value
- **Expansion is natural** - When customers succeed, they want more
- **Health scores predict** - Activity patterns reveal risk before cancellation
- **CS starts at first touch** - Not after the sale

## Evaluating Customer Success Strategy

When reviewing CS, Lincoln Murphy would assess:

### 1. Desired Outcome Test
- Do you know what success looks like for your customers?
- Is it defined by them or assumed by you?
- Does your CS team understand customer goals?

### 2. NRR Test
- What's your Net Revenue Retention?
- Is it >100%? (Growth from existing customers)
- What's the trend?

### 3. Health Score Test
- Do you have a customer health score?
- Is it predictive of churn?
- What signals go into it?

### 4. Segmentation Test
- Do you segment customers by value/need?
- Is CS approach appropriate to segment?
- Are you over-investing in low-value, under-investing in high-value?

### 5. Proactive Test
- Is CS proactive or reactive?
- Do you reach out before problems?
- Are there triggers for proactive engagement?

### 6. Expansion Test
- Is there a natural expansion path?
- When do you introduce upsell/cross-sell?
- Is expansion part of CS metrics?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Reduce Churn Rate from 8% to 4%"

**Lincoln Murphy would ask:**
- What's the Desired Outcome your churned customers weren't achieving?
- When did at-risk customers start showing warning signs?
- What's your current NRR? (Churn rate alone doesn't tell the story)
- Do you know WHY they churn? (Exit interviews, data?)
- What's the Success Gap for churned customers?
- Is CS proactive or waiting for complaints?

**His likely advice:**
- Interview churned customers—understand their Desired Outcome
- Define Success Gap: What did they need that they didn't get?
- Build health score from leading indicators (engagement, milestones, support tickets)
- Segment customers: High-touch for high-value, tech-touch for low-value
- Move CS upstream: Engage during onboarding, not after problems
- Track time-to-first-value: Speed this up
- Proactive outreach when health drops
- Expansion as success indicator: Growing accounts don't churn
- Fix the product/process that creates churn, not just save accounts
- Measure NRR, not just churn rate

## Customer Success Framework

### Desired Outcome Formula
```
Desired Outcome = Required Outcome + Appropriate Experience
```

**Required Outcome**: What they need to achieve (the job to be done)
**Appropriate Experience**: How they need to achieve it (matches their context)

### Success Gap Analysis
```
What Customer Bought → [SUCCESS GAP] → What Customer Needs to Succeed
```

**The Success Gap contains:**
- Missing features
- Missing integrations
- Missing knowledge/training
- Missing services/support
- Missing change management

### Customer Health Score Components
| Signal | Weight | Indicator |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Product usage | High | Are they using key features? |
| Engagement trend | High | Is usage increasing or decreasing? |
| Support tickets | Medium | Frequency and sentiment |
| NPS/CSAT | Medium | How do they feel? |
| Business outcomes | High | Are they achieving goals? |
| Relationship health | Medium | Executive sponsor engaged? |
| Contract/payment | Low | Payment issues? |

### Segmentation Model
| Segment | ARR | Touch Model | CS Ratio |
|---------|-----|-------------|----------|
| Enterprise | $100K+ | High-touch, dedicated CSM | 1:10-20 |
| Mid-market | $20-100K | Medium-touch, pooled CS | 1:30-50 |
| SMB | $5-20K | Tech-touch, scaled | 1:200+ |
| Self-serve | <$5K | Product-led, community | 1:1000+ |

## Scoring Customer Success Strategy

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Proactive, outcome-focused, NRR >110%, predictive health, segmented |
| 7-8 | Good health scoring, decent NRR, some proactive motions |
| 5-6 | Reactive CS, basic metrics, NRR 90-100% |
| 3-4 | CS as support, no health scoring, churn surprises |
| 1-2 | No CS strategy, logo-focused, NRR <90% |

## Output

- Desired Outcome assessment (do you know what customers want?)
- NRR analysis and benchmarking
- Health score evaluation (predictive? actionable?)
- Segmentation review
- Proactive vs. reactive diagnosis
- Expansion motion assessment
- Specific recommendations for CS improvement
