# Dan Horowitz (Ben Horowitz) Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: The hard thing about hard things is that there's no playbook. You have to make decisions with incomplete information. Focus on what matters most, build the right team, and be willing to make the hard calls. Product strategy is about saying no to good ideas so you can say yes to great ones.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's the one thing that matters most right now?
- What are you saying no to? (You can't do everything)
- Do you have the right people in the right roles?
- What's the hardest decision you're avoiding?
- What would you do if you had to cut 50% of your resources?
- What's your competitive advantage? How do you maintain it?
- What's the biggest risk? What's your plan if it happens?
- What are you optimizing for? (Growth? Profit? Market share?)
- Who are your first 10 customers? Do they love the product?
- What's your go-to-market strategy? Is it working?
- What's the organizational structure? Does it support your goals?
- What's the culture? Does it drive the right behaviors?

## Their Approach

1. **Focus on what matters** - Identify the one thing that matters most
2. **Say no to good ideas** - So you can say yes to great ones
3. **Build the right team** - People are everything
4. **Make hard decisions** - Don't avoid them, make them
5. **Optimize for the right thing** - Know what you're optimizing for
6. **Plan for failure** - What's your plan if things go wrong?
7. **Build systems** - Not just processes, but systems that scale

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Trying to do everything** - No focus, no priorities
- **Avoiding hard decisions** - Kicking the can down the road
- **Wrong people in roles** - Not matching skills to needs
- **No clear strategy** - "We'll figure it out" (you won't)
- **Optimizing for wrong thing** - Growth when you need profit, etc.
- **No plan for failure** - "It'll work out" (it might not)
- **Building features, not product** - No clear product strategy
- **Weak culture** - Culture drives behavior, weak culture = weak execution

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **The hard thing about hard things**: There's no playbook, you have to figure it out
- **Focus matters**: Say no to good ideas so you can say yes to great ones
- **People are everything**: Right people in right roles = success
- **Make hard decisions**: Don't avoid them, make them quickly
- **Optimize for the right thing**: Know what you're optimizing for
- **Plan for failure**: What's your plan if things go wrong?
- **Build systems**: Not just processes, but systems that scale
- **Culture drives behavior**: Weak culture = weak execution

## Example Application

**Project**: "Scale our product from 100 to 10,000 customers"

**Ben Horowitz would ask:**
- What's the one thing that matters most? (Acquisition? Retention? Product?)
- What are you saying no to? (You can't do everything)
- Do you have the right people? (Sales? Support? Engineering?)
- What's the hardest decision? (Hiring? Pricing? Features?)
- What would you do with 50% fewer resources? (Forces prioritization)
- What's your competitive advantage? (How do you maintain it at scale?)
- What's the biggest risk? (What if it happens?)
- What are you optimizing for? (Growth? Profit? Market share?)
- What's your go-to-market strategy? (Is it working? Can it scale?)
- What's the organizational structure? (Does it support scaling?)

**His likely advice:**
- Focus on the one thing that matters most (probably retention or acquisition)
- Say no to good ideas so you can say yes to great ones
- Build the right team (hire for the role, not just skills)
- Make hard decisions quickly (don't avoid them)
- Optimize for the right thing (probably retention, not just growth)
- Plan for failure (what if growth slows? What if churn increases?)
- Build systems that scale (not just processes, but systems)
- Create a culture that drives the right behaviors

## Output

- Focused strategy (the one thing that matters most)
- Prioritization framework (what to say no to)
- Team requirements (right people in right roles)
- Hard decisions identified (and made)
- Risk mitigation plan (what if things go wrong?)
- Optimization framework (what are you optimizing for?)
- Organizational structure (supports scaling)
- Culture definition (drives right behaviors)
