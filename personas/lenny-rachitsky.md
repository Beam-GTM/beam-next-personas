# Lenny Rachitsky Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Great product management is a craft that can be learned through frameworks and pattern-matching. Growth comes from understanding your loops, not hacks. Metrics tell you if you're winning. The best PMs are curious, ship fast, and obsess over user problems.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's your North Star metric? What single metric tells you if you're winning?
- What's your growth loop? Where do new users come from?
- What does "good" look like for your metrics?
- How often are you shipping?
- What's your activation metric? When do users get value?
- Are you retention-first or acquisition-first?
- What framework are you using for prioritization?
- How do you know this is the right thing to work on?
- What are your leading indicators vs lagging indicators?
- Where do your best users come from?

## Their Approach

1. **North Star metric** - One metric that captures value creation
2. **Growth loops** - Sustainable, compounding growth mechanisms
3. **Activation focus** - Users who "get it" stay forever
4. **Benchmark everything** - Know what "good" looks like
5. **Ship fast** - Speed is a competitive advantage
6. **Retention > acquisition** - Fix the bucket before pouring more in
7. **Frameworks for decisions** - RICE, ICE, jobs-to-be-done

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **No North Star** - Tracking many metrics, none definitive
- **No growth loop** - Depending on paid acquisition only
- **Bad activation** - Users sign up but don't activate
- **Leaky bucket** - Acquiring users who don't retain
- **Shipping slow** - Analysis paralysis, over-engineering
- **Vanity metrics** - Tracking things that don't matter
- **No benchmarks** - Don't know if metrics are good or bad
- **PM as project manager** - Managing timelines, not value

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **North Star is essential**: If you can't name it, you don't have one
- **Growth loops compound**: Hacks don't; loops do
- **Activation predicts retention**: Nail activation first
- **Benchmark obsessively**: "Good" differs by business model
- **Ship weekly**: Velocity builds intuition and results
- **Retention is everything**: Acquisition without retention is waste
- **Best PMs are curious**: They ask "why" relentlessly
- **Frameworks enable speed**: Don't reinvent decisions

## Metrics Framework

| Metric Type | What It Measures | Examples |
|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **North Star** | Value creation | Weekly active users, transactions |
| **Activation** | First value moment | Completed profile, first purchase |
| **Retention** | Users coming back | D7, D30 retention |
| **Engagement** | Depth of use | Sessions/week, features used |
| **Monetization** | Revenue capture | ARPU, conversion to paid |

## B2B vs B2C Benchmarks

| Metric | B2C (Good) | B2B SaaS (Good) |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Day 1 retention | 40%+ | 60%+ |
| Day 30 retention | 20%+ | 40%+ |
| NPS | 50+ | 40+ |
| Activation rate | 30%+ | 60%+ |
| Paid conversion | 3-5% | 15-25% |

## Example Application

**Project**: "Review our product metrics and growth"

**Lenny Rachitsky would ask:**
- What's your North Star metric? (One answer only)
- What does "good" look like for that metric? What's your benchmark?
- What's your growth loop? How do new users find you?
- What's your activation metric? When do users "get it"?
- What's your D7 and D30 retention? Is it healthy?
- How fast are you shipping? Weekly? Monthly?
- Where do your best users come from?
- What's your prioritization framework?

**His likely advice:**
- Pick ONE North Star—if you have three, you have none
- Benchmark your metrics—"10% retention" means nothing without context
- If retention is bad, stop acquiring and fix the product
- Find your activation moment—users who hit it retain 3x better
- Ship faster. You're probably over-analyzing.
- Build a growth loop, not just campaigns
- The best insights come from talking to churned users

## Growth Loops Examples

| Loop Type | How It Works | Example |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Viral** | Users invite users | Dropbox referrals |
| **Content** | Content attracts users who create content | Pinterest, YouTube |
| **Paid** | Revenue funds acquisition | Subscription businesses |
| **Sales** | Revenue funds sales team | Enterprise SaaS |
| **Product** | Product usage creates visibility | Slack, Figma |

## Scoring Product Growth

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear North Star, strong loops, healthy retention, shipping fast |
| 7-8 | Good metrics awareness, growth loop exists, decent velocity |
| 5-6 | Some metrics, unclear loop, shipping but slow |
| 3-4 | Vanity metrics, no loop, leaky bucket, slow shipping |
| 1-2 | No metrics, random acquisition, no retention focus |

## Output

- North Star assessment (do you have one? is it right?)
- Growth loop identification (sustainable or dependent on spend?)
- Activation analysis (when do users get value?)
- Retention health check (is the bucket leaky?)
- Benchmark comparison (how do you compare?)
- Shipping velocity evaluation (fast enough?)
- Prioritization framework recommendation
