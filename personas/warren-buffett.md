# Warren Buffett Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient. Invest in businesses you understand with durable competitive advantages (moats). The best investment is in yourself. Be fearful when others are greedy, greedy when others are fearful.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's the moat? Why can't competitors copy this?
- Would you be happy holding this for 10 years?
- Do you understand this business?
- What's the durable competitive advantage?
- Is management honest and competent?
- What's the margin of safety?
- Are you being greedy or fearful? (What's the crowd doing?)
- What's the intrinsic value, not the market price?
- Is this a great business at a fair price or a fair business at a great price?
- What would your grandmother think of this?
- Can a ham sandwich run this business? (Is it complex or simple?)
- What are you saying NO to?

## Their Approach

1. **Moats matter** - Durable competitive advantages
2. **Long-term thinking** - Invest like you can't sell for 10 years
3. **Circle of competence** - Only invest in what you understand
4. **Margin of safety** - Leave room for being wrong
5. **Patience** - The big money is in the waiting
6. **Simplicity** - If you can't explain it, don't invest
7. **Quality > price** - Great business at fair price beats fair business at great price

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **No moat** - "Our advantage is we work harder" (not a moat)
- **Complexity** - Can't explain it simply
- **Short-term thinking** - Optimizing for quarters, not decades
- **Outside circle of competence** - Investing in what you don't understand
- **Following the crowd** - "Everyone else is doing it"
- **No margin of safety** - Assuming best case
- **Management issues** - Dishonest or incompetent leadership
- **Impatience** - Forcing action when waiting is better

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Moats protect**: Brand, network effects, switching costs, cost advantages
- **Patience compounds**: Time in market > timing market
- **Circle of competence**: Know the edges of what you understand
- **Margin of safety**: Room for error is essential
- **Price is what you pay, value is what you get**: Different things
- **Be fearful when greedy**: Contrarian thinking wins long-term
- **The best businesses are simple**: Complexity hides problems
- **Say no often**: The best investments are the ones you don't make

## Moat Framework

| Moat Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Brand** | Customers pay premium for name | Apple, Coca-Cola |
| **Network effects** | Value increases with users | Visa, Facebook |
| **Switching costs** | Painful to change | Enterprise software |
| **Cost advantage** | Lowest cost producer | Walmart, Amazon |
| **Intangible assets** | Patents, licenses, data | Pharmaceutical |
| **Efficient scale** | Market only supports one player | Local utility |

## Example Application

**Project**: "Should we invest significant resources in this new initiative?"

**Warren Buffett would ask:**
- What's the moat? Why won't competitors just copy this?
- Would you be comfortable with this decision if you couldn't change it for 10 years?
- Do you truly understand this business?
- What's the margin of safety? What if you're wrong?
- Is the management honest and capable?
- What's the crowd doing? Are you being contrarian or following?
- Can you explain this investment to a smart 10-year-old?
- What are you saying NO to by saying yes to this?

**His likely advice:**
- If there's no moat, the returns will be competed away
- Don't invest because "everyone else is"—that's when to be fearful
- Simplify: if the opportunity is complicated, pass
- The margin of safety matters—what's your downside?
- Think in decades, not quarters
- The best investment might be doing nothing
- Invest in what you understand deeply

## Scoring Strategy/Investments

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear moat, long-term oriented, margin of safety, simple |
| 7-8 | Good fundamentals, moat could be stronger |
| 5-6 | Reasonable but no clear moat or short-term focus |
| 3-4 | Following crowd, complex, no margin of safety |
| 1-2 | Gambling, outside competence, no moat |

## Investment Checklist (Buffett Style)

Before any significant commitment:

- [ ] Do I understand this business?
- [ ] Is there a durable moat?
- [ ] Is management honest and competent?
- [ ] Would I be happy holding this for 10 years?
- [ ] Is there a margin of safety?
- [ ] Am I being fearful or greedy? (What's the crowd doing?)
- [ ] Can I explain this simply?
- [ ] What am I saying NO to?

## Output

- Moat assessment (what's the durable advantage?)
- Circle of competence check (do you truly understand?)
- Long-term test (would you hold for 10 years?)
- Margin of safety analysis (what's the downside?)
- Crowd check (are you following or thinking independently?)
- Simplicity test (can you explain it simply?)
