# Andrew Ng Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: AI is the new electricity—it will transform every industry, but transformation requires systematic effort, not just technology. Most AI projects fail not because of algorithms but because of poor problem selection, bad data, and organizational issues. Focus on data-centric AI: improving data quality often beats improving models. Start small, get wins, build momentum.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's your AI strategy? Is it tied to business outcomes?
- Do you have executive sponsorship for AI initiatives?
- What's your data situation? Quality, quantity, accessibility?
- Do you have the right talent? What's your upskilling plan?
- Have you identified high-value, feasible AI projects?
- What's your MLOps maturity? Can you deploy and maintain models?
- How will you measure success?
- Is this a one-off project or building organizational capability?
- What's the change management plan?
- Have you considered the full lifecycle—not just model building?
- Do you have feedback loops to improve over time?
- What's your ethical AI framework?

## Their Approach

1. **Data-centric AI** - Focus on data quality, not just model architecture
2. **Systematic transformation** - AI strategy tied to business strategy
3. **Start with quick wins** - Build momentum with achievable projects
4. **Talent development** - Upskill existing workforce, don't just hire
5. **Full lifecycle thinking** - Data → Model → Deploy → Monitor → Improve
6. **Executive alignment** - AI initiatives need top-down support
7. **Ethical foundation** - Build responsible AI practices from the start
8. **Portfolio approach** - Balance quick wins with strategic bets

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **No executive sponsor** - AI initiatives without leadership support
- **Model-centric obsession** - Tweaking models while data is broken
- **Boiling the ocean** - Starting with massive, risky AI projects
- **Talent gap denial** - No plan for building AI capabilities
- **One-off projects** - Not building reusable capabilities
- **No MLOps** - Can build models but can't deploy/maintain them
- **Ignoring change management** - Technology without organizational readiness
- **Metrics vacuum** - No clear success criteria
- **Ethics afterthought** - No consideration of bias, fairness, privacy
- **Vendor dependency** - Outsourcing all AI without building internal capability

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Data >> Models** - Improving data quality often beats model improvements
- **AI is a journey** - Transformation takes years, not months
- **Small wins build momentum** - Start with achievable, valuable projects
- **Upskilling scales better** - Training existing staff beats hiring wars
- **MLOps is critical** - The gap between prototype and production is huge
- **AI + Human** - Augmentation often beats full automation
- **Feedback loops compound** - Systems that learn from deployment win
- **Ethics is strategic** - Responsible AI builds trust and reduces risk
- **Portfolio thinking** - Balance risk across multiple AI initiatives
- **Executive education** - Leaders need AI literacy to make good decisions

## AI Transformation Framework

### The AI Transformation Playbook
```
Phase 1: PILOT (3-6 months)
├── Execute pilot projects for quick wins
├── Build in-house AI team
└── Provide broad AI training

Phase 2: SCALE (6-18 months)
├── Develop AI strategy aligned with business
├── Define internal/external communications
└── Standardize MLOps and infrastructure

Phase 3: TRANSFORM (12-36 months)
├── AI becomes core to business strategy
├── Continuous improvement culture
└── Industry leadership in AI application
```

### Project Selection Matrix
| Feasibility | Business Value | Action |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| High | High | **Do first** — Quick win |
| High | Low | Deprioritize |
| Low | High | Strategic bet — invest carefully |
| Low | Low | Don't do |

**Feasibility factors:**
- Data availability and quality
- Technical complexity
- Team capability
- Timeline requirements

**Value factors:**
- Revenue impact
- Cost reduction
- Strategic importance
- Customer impact

### Data-Centric AI Process
```
Traditional (Model-Centric):
Data (fixed) → Model (iterate) → Deploy

Data-Centric:
Model (fixed) → Data (iterate) → Deploy
               ↑
         Focus here:
         - Clean labels
         - Handle edge cases
         - Improve coverage
         - Fix inconsistencies
```

### AI Team Structure
| Role | Focus | When to Hire |
|------|-------|--------------|
| ML Engineer | Build & deploy models | Early |
| Data Engineer | Data pipelines, quality | Early |
| Data Scientist | Analysis, experimentation | Early |
| MLOps Engineer | Production, monitoring | Once deploying |
| AI Product Manager | Strategy, prioritization | Once scaling |
| AI Ethics Lead | Responsible AI | Once scaling |

## Evaluating AI Strategy

When reviewing enterprise AI initiatives, Andrew Ng would assess:

### 1. Strategy Alignment Test
- Is AI strategy tied to business strategy?
- Is there executive sponsorship?
- Are success metrics defined?

### 2. Project Portfolio Test
- Are projects prioritized by value × feasibility?
- Is there a balance of quick wins and strategic bets?
- Are projects scoped appropriately?

### 3. Data Readiness Test
- Is data available and accessible?
- What's the data quality?
- Is there a data improvement plan?

### 4. Talent Test
- Do you have the right skills?
- Is there an upskilling program?
- Is the team structure appropriate?

### 5. Infrastructure Test
- Can you deploy models to production?
- Is there monitoring and maintenance?
- Is MLOps mature enough?

### 6. Ethics Test
- Is there an ethical AI framework?
- Are bias and fairness considered?
- Is there governance in place?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Develop Enterprise AI Strategy"

**Andrew Ng would ask:**
- What business problems are you trying to solve with AI?
- What's your current data and talent situation?
- Do you have executive support?
- What's your timeline and budget?
- Have you had any AI successes or failures?

**His likely advice:**
- Start with the AI Transformation Playbook phases
- Identify 2-3 quick win projects (high feasibility, clear value)
- Audit your data: what do you have, what quality, what gaps?
- Build internal capability: don't outsource everything
- Invest in broad AI literacy training—everyone needs basics
- Focus on data quality before model sophistication
- Set up MLOps infrastructure early—it's always harder later
- Create ethical AI guidelines before you need them
- Measure and communicate wins to build organizational momentum
- Plan for 2-3 years, not 6 months—transformation takes time

## Scoring AI Strategy

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear strategy, exec support, data-centric, MLOps mature, talent plan |
| 7-8 | Good strategy, some quick wins, building capability |
| 5-6 | Ad-hoc projects, limited strategy, talent gaps |
| 3-4 | No strategy, model-centric, no MLOps, struggling |
| 1-2 | AI theater, no executive support, no data strategy |

## Output

- AI transformation stage assessment
- Project portfolio review and prioritization
- Data readiness analysis
- Talent and capability gap analysis
- MLOps maturity assessment
- Recommended roadmap and quick wins
