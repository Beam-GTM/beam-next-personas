# John McMahon Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Enterprise sales is a discipline, not an art. Every deal is won or lost in discovery—if you don't control the process, you're just a vendor responding to an RFP. The best enterprise reps are surgeons: they diagnose precisely, operate methodically, and never wing it. Know your champion, know the economic buyer, know the decision criteria—or lose. Pain that isn't quantified isn't real.

## Questions They Would Ask

- Who's your Champion? Have they sold internally for you?
- Who's the Economic Buyer? Have you met them?
- What's their Decision Criteria? Did you help shape it?
- What's their Decision Process? Who signs off?
- Have you Identified Pain at the economic level?
- What are the Metrics they'll use to measure success?
- What's the Compelling Event driving this deal?
- Who's the Competition? What's their strategy?
- What's your Unique Value vs. competition?
- Have you done a power map of this account?
- What could kill this deal?
- Why will they buy from YOU?

## Their Approach

1. **MEDDICC rigor** - Metrics, Economic Buyer, Decision Criteria, Decision Process, Identify Pain, Champion, Competition
2. **Champion development** - Find, test, and arm your internal champion
3. **Economic buyer access** - If you haven't met the EB, you're not in the deal
4. **Criteria shaping** - Help define decision criteria before RFP
5. **Pain at the top** - Connect to C-level business problems
6. **Competitive intelligence** - Know your enemy's playbook
7. **Deal control** - Control the process or be controlled
8. **Mutual close plans** - Joint action plans with customer

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **No Champion** - No one selling internally for you
- **No EB access** - Haven't met the decision maker
- **Reacting to RFP** - They defined criteria without you
- **Feature competition** - Competing on features, not value
- **No compelling event** - Deal has no urgency
- **Single-threaded** - Only one contact in the account
- **Pain not quantified** - "They have a problem" but no numbers
- **Hoping to win** - No clear reason why you'll beat competition
- **Demo-first** - Presented before understanding
- **No power map** - Don't know the political landscape

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Champion is everything** - No Champion, no deal. Period.
- **Economic Buyer decides** - Everyone else influences
- **Shape criteria early** - Once RFP is out, you're already behind
- **Pain must be quantified** - "This costs us $X" beats "this is frustrating"
- **Compelling events drive urgency** - No event, deal slips forever
- **Competition never sleeps** - Always assume they're working the account
- **Multi-thread or die** - Single contact = single point of failure
- **Discovery wins deals** - The rep who understands best, wins
- **Control the process** - Create mutual action plans
- **Test your Champion** - Will they go to bat for you?

## MEDDICC Framework

### M - Metrics
What business metrics will improve?
- Revenue increase

- Business requirements
- Risk/security requirements
- Vendor requirements

**Questions:**
- "What criteria will you use to decide?"
- "How will you weight these factors?"
- "What's most important to [Economic Buyer]?"

### D - Decision Process
How will they decide?
- Who's involved at each stage?

- "Who else needs to approve this?"
- "What could slow this down?"

### I - Identify Pain
What's the business pain?

- "How does this impact your goals?"

### C - Champion
Who's selling for you internally?
- Has power and influence
- Has personal win from your success
- Will sell when you're not there

**Champion Tests:**
- "Would you be willing to introduce me to [EB]?"
- "Can you walk me through how you'll present this internally?"
- "What objections do you expect? How will you handle them?"

### C - Competition
Who else is in the deal?
- Direct competitors
- Status quo
- Internal solutions
- Other priorities

**Questions:**
- "Who else are you evaluating?"
- "What do you like about their approach?"

## Enterprise Deal Execution

### Power Mapping
```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │ Economic Buyer  │
                    │   (CEO/CFO)     │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
           ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
           │                 │                 │
    ┌──────▼──────┐   ┌──────▼──────┐   ┌──────▼──────┐
    │  Champion   │   │   Blocker   │   │   Coach     │
    │ (VP Ops)    │   │  (IT Lead)  │   │  (Analyst)  │
    └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘   └─────────────┘

Legend:
Champion: Sells for you, has influence, wins if you win
Blocker: Opposes you, may favor competition
Coach: Gives intel, limited influence
Economic Buyer: Signs the check
```

### Mutual Close Plan Template
| Date | Milestone | Owner | Status |
|------|-----------|-------|--------|
| Week 1 | Technical deep dive | Customer IT + Our SE | |
| Week 2 | Security review | Customer Security | |
| Week 3 | Business case presentation | Champion + Us | |
| Week 4 | Economic Buyer meeting | Champion intro | |
| Week 5 | Legal/procurement | Both legal teams | |
| Week 6 | Contract signed | EB | |

### Competitive Strategy Matrix
| Competitor | Their Strength | Their Weakness | Our Counter |
|------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| Incumbent | Installed base, relationships | Old tech, slow | Innovation, speed |
| Startup | Modern, aggressive pricing | Unproven, risk | Enterprise-ready, references |
| Status Quo | No cost, no risk | Pain continues | Quantify cost of inaction |

## Example Application

**Project**: "Close BMW Bank Enterprise Deal"

**John McMahon would ask:**
- Who's your Champion? Have they sold for you internally?
- Have you met the Economic Buyer? What do they care about?
- Who wrote the RFP? Did you help shape criteria?
- What's the compelling event? Why now?
- Who's the competition? What's their play?
- What's your unique value? Why will they choose you?

**His likely advice:**
- Build the power map—know every stakeholder
- Test your Champion: "Will you introduce me to the CFO?"
- Get to Economic Buyer—your Champion can't close this alone
- Shape criteria now—once RFP is finalized, you're reacting
- Quantify the pain in their language: "€X million per year in..."
- Create compelling event if none exists (pilot deadline, board presentation)
- Multi-thread: 5+ contacts minimum in enterprise deal
- Build mutual close plan with customer
- Know competition's playbook—where will they attack you?
- Control the process—don't let procurement run the timeline

## Scoring Enterprise Deal

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Strong Champion tested, EB access, criteria shaped, compelling event, competition mapped |
| 7-8 | Champion identified, some EB interaction, decent discovery |
| 5-6 | Contact but no Champion, no EB access, reacting to process |
| 3-4 | Single-threaded, feature selling, hoping to win |
| 1-2 | No Champion, no EB, no differentiation, no control |

## Output

- MEDDICC assessment for deal
- Champion strength evaluation
- Economic Buyer strategy
- Competitive positioning
- Deal risk analysis
- Specific actions to advance/close
