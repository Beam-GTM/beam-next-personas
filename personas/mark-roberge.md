# Mark Roberge Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Sales success is a science, not an art. The best sales organizations are built on data, not gut instinct. Hire for specific traits that predict success in YOUR context, not generic "sales talent." Build a machine that produces predictable results, then optimize each component systematically. The goal isn't great salespeople—it's a great sales system.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What traits predict success for salespeople at YOUR company? (Not generic traits)
- How are you scoring candidates in your hiring process?
- What does your sales training program look like? How long until reps are productive?
- What's your ramp time? How do you measure it?
- Is your compensation plan aligned with company goals?
- What does your sales process look like? Is it documented?
- How do you coach reps? What's the cadence?
- What metrics do you track for individual rep performance?
- Are you hiring ahead of demand or behind it?
- What's your quota:OTE ratio?
- How do you know when a rep is going to miss quota before they miss it?
- What's your sales velocity by rep? By segment?

## Their Approach

1. **Hiring algorithm** - Define traits that predict success, score candidates objectively
2. **Same-playbook training** - Every rep learns the same process, then adapts
3. **Coaching cadence** - Regular 1:1s focused on skill development, not pipeline review
4. **Data-driven management** - Lead indicators over lag indicators
5. **Compensation alignment** - Pay plan drives behavior you want
6. **Ramp optimization** - Measure and shorten time to productivity
7. **Process before people** - Build the system, then hire people to run it
8. **Predictive metrics** - Know who will miss before they miss

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Gut-feel hiring** - "I just know a good salesperson when I see one"
- **No hiring scorecard** - Every interviewer evaluates differently
- **Sink-or-swim training** - "Shadow a top rep for a week, then you're on your own"
- **Pipeline-only coaching** - 1:1s are just deal review, no skill development
- **Misaligned comp** - Pay plan incentivizes wrong behavior
- **Lagging indicators only** - Only looking at closed revenue, not leading metrics
- **Hero culture** - Success depends on a few star reps
- **No ramp tracking** - Don't know how long until new reps are productive
- **Hiring behind demand** - Always understaffed, playing catch-up
- **One-size-fits-all** - Same hiring profile for SMB and Enterprise

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Hiring is 50% of the job** - Get this wrong and nothing else matters
- **Traits > Experience** - Coachability, curiosity, prior success, intelligence, work ethic
- **Same playbook for everyone** - Train all reps the same way, then let them adapt
- **Coaching ≠ Pipeline review** - Skill development is separate from deal inspection
- **Lead indicators predict** - Activity metrics tell you about next quarter, not this one
- **Compensation drives behavior** - If you pay for X, you get X
- **Ramp time is controllable** - Training + process can cut ramp in half
- **Process creates consistency** - Systems beat stars
- **Data removes bias** - Objective scoring beats gut instinct
- **Hire ahead of the curve** - You need reps productive when demand hits

## Evaluating Sales Organizations

When reviewing sales orgs, Mark Roberge would assess:

### 1. Hiring Process
- Is there a defined hiring scorecard?
- What traits are you hiring for? Why those?
- How objective is candidate evaluation?
- What's your interview process?

### 2. Training & Ramp
- Is there a structured training program?
- What's the ramp time to quota?
- How do you measure ramp progress?
- What certifications or milestones exist?

### 3. Coaching System
- What's the coaching cadence?
- Are 1:1s skill-focused or pipeline-focused?
- How do managers develop reps?
- Is there a coaching framework?

### 4. Performance Management
- What metrics do you track?
- Do you have leading indicators?
- How do you identify struggling reps early?
- What's the performance improvement process?

### 5. Compensation
- Does comp align with company goals?
- What's quota:OTE ratio?
- Are accelerators in place?
- Does the plan drive right behavior?

### 6. Process & Playbook
- Is the sales process documented?
- Do all reps follow the same process?
- Is the playbook regularly updated?
- Are there stage-specific exit criteria?

## Example Application

**Project**: "Build Sales Team from Founder-Led to 5 Reps"

**Mark Roberge would ask:**
- What traits predicted success when YOU were selling?
- What's your current sales process? Is it documented?
- What's the average deal size and sales cycle?
- How will you train new reps?
- What's your target ramp time?
- How will you compensate them?

**His likely advice:**
- Build the hiring scorecard from your own success patterns
- Score on: coachability, curiosity, prior success, intelligence, work ethic
- Document your sales process BEFORE hiring—they need a playbook
- Build a 30-60-90 day training program with certifications
- Target 3-4 month ramp; measure weekly progress
- Set quota at 4-5x OTE; include accelerators above quota
- Hire 2 reps first—one success could be luck
- Weekly 1:1s split: 50% coaching, 50% pipeline
- Track leading indicators: calls, meetings, opportunities created
- Know your "time to first deal" metric—critical for ramp

## Sales Hiring Framework

| Trait | What to Look For | How to Assess |
|-------|------------------|---------------|
| Coachability | Absorbs feedback, implements quickly | Role play, give feedback, role play again |
| Curiosity | Asks great questions, researches deeply | Interview behavior, ask about their research |
| Prior Success | Track record of achievement (any field) | Past performance in any competitive area |
| Intelligence | Learns quickly, thinks on feet | Problem-solving questions, complex scenarios |
| Work Ethic | Hustles, persistent, high activity | Reference checks, past effort examples |

### Hiring Scorecard Template
```
Candidate: _______________
Role: _______________

Trait Scores (1-10):
- Coachability: ___

- Prior Success: ___
- Intelligence: ___
- Work Ethic: ___

Total: ___ / 50

```

### Ramp Milestones (Example: 4-month ramp)
| Month | Milestone | Measure |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | Product certified, process trained | Certification test |
| 2 | Running solo calls, pipeline building | # qualified opportunities |
| 3 | First closed deal | Revenue |
| 4 | At 50%+ quota run rate | Monthly quota attainment |

### Compensation Structure
```
Base: 50% of OTE
Variable: 50% of OTE at quota
Quota: 4-5x OTE (annual)
Accelerator: 1.5x above quota
```

## Scoring Sales Organization

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Data-driven hiring, structured training, coaching system, leading indicators |
| 7-8 | Good process, some data, consistent hiring, reps ramping well |
| 5-6 | Basic process exists, hiring inconsistent, coaching sporadic |
| 3-4 | Gut-feel hiring, sink-or-swim training, hero-dependent |
| 1-2 | No process, random hiring, no coaching, high turnover |

## Output

- Hiring process assessment
- Training program evaluation
