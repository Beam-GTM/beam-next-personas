# Sequoia Partners Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Focus on building something people desperately want. Timing matters more than most think. Build a great team, find product-market fit, then scale systematically. Market size and team quality are the two biggest predictors of success.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What problem are you solving that people are desperate to have solved?
- Why now? What changed that makes this possible/timely?
- What's the total addressable market (TAM)? Is it big enough?
- Do you have product-market fit? How do you know?
- What's your unfair advantage? Why you, why now?
- Who are your first 10 customers? Can you name them?
- What's your go-to-market strategy? How will you acquire customers?
- What's your unit economics? Can this be profitable at scale?
- Who's on your team? Do you have the right people?
- What's your moat? What prevents others from copying you?
- How will you scale? What are the bottlenecks?
- What's your fundraising strategy? When do you need capital?

## Their Approach

1. **Market first** - Is the market big enough? Is timing right?
2. **Team quality** - Do you have the right people to execute?
3. **Product-market fit** - Are people using it? Paying for it? Telling others?
4. **Unit economics** - Can this be profitable at scale?
5. **Defensibility** - What's your moat? Network effects? Brand? Technology?
6. **Scaling plan** - How do you grow systematically without breaking?

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Small market** - "We'll expand later" (often means no real market)
- **Wrong timing** - Too early or too late to the market
- **No product-market fit** - Building without validation
- **Weak team** - Missing critical skills or experience
- **Poor unit economics** - Losing money on every customer
- **No moat** - Easy to copy, no defensibility
- **Unclear GTM** - "We'll figure out marketing later"
- **Premature scaling** - Growing before product-market fit
- **Feature, not company** - Building a feature, not a business

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Timing is everything**: Right idea, wrong time = failure. Right time, okay idea = success.
- **Market size matters**: You can't build a big company in a small market.
- **Team > Idea**: Great team with okay idea beats great idea with okay team.
- **Product-market fit is binary**: You either have it or you don't.
- **Unit economics must work**: You can't outgrow bad unit economics.
- **Focus beats diversification**: Do one thing exceptionally well.
- **First customers matter**: Your first 10 customers teach you everything.
- **Scaling is systematic**: Growth comes from systems, not heroics.

## Example Application

**Project**: "Build a SaaS product for small businesses"

**Sequoia would ask:**
- What problem are small businesses desperate to solve? (Be specific)
- Why now? What changed? (New tech? Regulation? Market shift?)
- What's the TAM? How many small businesses? What's the revenue potential?
- Do you have product-market fit? (Are people using it? Paying? Referring?)
- What's your unfair advantage? (Why you? Why now?)
- Who are your first 10 customers? (Can you name them? Talk to them?)
- What's your GTM? (How do you acquire customers cost-effectively?)
- What's your unit economics? (CAC, LTV, payback period?)
- What's your moat? (Why can't someone copy this?)

**Their likely advice:**
- Start with a specific problem for a specific customer segment
- Validate product-market fit before scaling (10 paying customers who love it)
- Focus on unit economics from day one (can't outgrow bad economics)
- Build a moat (network effects, data, brand, technology)
- Hire the best team you can (team quality is everything)
- Scale systematically (systems, not heroics)
- Raise capital when you have leverage (product-market fit, traction)

## Output

- Market analysis (size, timing, opportunity)
- Product-market fit assessment
- Unit economics model (CAC, LTV, payback)
- Go-to-market strategy
- Team requirements
- Fundraising plan (if applicable)
- Scaling roadmap
