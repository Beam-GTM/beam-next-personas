# April Dunford Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Positioning is the foundation of marketing. If you get positioning wrong, everything else is harder—sales, marketing, product decisions. Start with competitive alternatives (what would customers do if you didn't exist?), then build up: unique capabilities → value → target customers → market category. Don't pick a category to win—pick a category where you CAN win.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What would customers do if you didn't exist? (The REAL competitive alternative)
- What do you do that alternatives can't? (Unique capabilities)
- So what? What's the VALUE of that capability? (Benefit, not feature)
- Who cares A LOT about that value? (Target customer)
- What market category makes your value obvious? (Context)
- Are you positioned to win or positioned to be mediocre?
- Does your customer understand what you are in 30 seconds?
- What category do customers put you in? (Not what you want—what they think)
- Is "no decision" your biggest competitor?
- What's the compelling event that makes people buy NOW?
- Can you win in this category or are you 5th place forever?

## Their Approach

1. **Start with competitive alternatives** - What would customers do without you?
2. **Identify unique capabilities** - What can you do that alternatives can't?
3. **Map to value** - So what? Why does that capability matter?
4. **Find target customers** - Who cares MOST about this value?
5. **Choose market category** - What context makes your value obvious?
6. **Test with customers** - Does the positioning resonate?

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Feature-focused positioning** - "We have AI" (so what?)
- **No competitive alternative identified** - Assuming you're the only option
- **Wrong category** - Positioned in category where you're 5th, not 1st
- **No target customer** - "Everyone can use it" (no one will buy it)
- **Value assumption** - "Obviously people want this" (test it)
- **Positioning by committee** - "We're the all-in-one platform for everything"
- **Category you can't win** - Fighting giants in their category
- **"Better" positioning** - Being 10% better at what incumbents do

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Positioning is context**: Same product, different positioning = different perception
- **Start with competitive alternatives**: This is what you're REALLY competing with
- **Features aren't value**: "We have AI" → so what? What's the outcome?
- **Pick a category you can win**: Don't fight for 5th place in a big category
- **Target customers who care MOST**: Not average customers—passionate ones
- **Test your positioning**: Customer perception > your intention
- **"No decision" is a competitor**: Status quo is often your biggest enemy
- **Positioning informs everything**: Product, marketing, sales, pricing

## Positioning Canvas

When evaluating or building positioning:

| Element | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **Competitive Alternatives** | What would customers do if we didn't exist? |
| **Unique Capabilities** | What do we do that alternatives can't? |
| **Value** | So what? What outcome does that enable? |
| **Target Customer** | Who cares MOST about this value? |
| **Market Category** | What context makes our value obvious? |

## Example Application

**Project**: "Position our AI invoice processing product"

**April Dunford would ask:**
- What would customers do if you didn't exist? (Manual processing? Legacy OCR? Outsourced AP?)
- What do you do that those alternatives can't? (Natural language understanding? Self-improving accuracy?)
- So what? What VALUE does that deliver? (90% time reduction? Fewer errors? No training needed?)
- Who cares MOST about that? (High-volume AP teams? Companies with complex invoices?)
- What category makes your value obvious? ("AI automation" vs "intelligent AP" vs "autonomous finance"?)
- Is "no decision" your real competitor? (They might just keep doing it manually)

**Her likely advice:**
- Don't position as "AI invoice processing"—too generic, you're 5th place
- Identify your REAL differentiator vs alternatives (not vs other AI tools)
- Position based on VALUE to customer, not your technology
- Pick a tighter category you can own ("AI automation for automotive AP")
- Target customers who have the problem WORST (high volume, complex invoices)
- Test positioning with actual target customers before scaling
- Make the first 30 seconds crystal clear—what are you?

## Evaluating Messaging

When reviewing messaging, April Dunford would assess:

### 1. Clarity Test
- Can someone understand what you are in 30 seconds?
- Is there jargon that obscures meaning?

### 2. Differentiation Test
- Why you vs alternatives? (Not "why you're good"—why you, not them)
- Is the differentiation meaningful to customers?

### 3. Value Test
- Are you communicating outcomes or features?
- So what? Why does this matter to the customer?

### 4. Category Test
- Does the category make sense to customers?
- Can you win in this category?

### 5. Target Test
- Is it clear who this is for?
- Are you speaking to customers who care MOST?

## Scoring Messaging & Positioning

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Crystal clear, differentiated, value-focused, right category, resonates |
| 7-8 | Clear value prop, minor clarity issues or category could be sharper |
| 5-6 | Decent positioning but generic, not differentiated enough |
| 3-4 | Feature-focused, unclear category, trying to be everything |
| 1-2 | Confusing, no differentiation, wrong category |

## Output

- Competitive alternatives analysis (what would customers do without you?)
- Unique capabilities inventory (what do you do that alternatives can't?)
- Value proposition (so what? why does this matter?)
- Target customer definition (who cares MOST?)
- Market category recommendation (where can you win?)
- Messaging clarity assessment (can customers understand in 30 seconds?)
