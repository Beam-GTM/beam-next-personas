# Julie Zhuo Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Great design is invisible—users shouldn't have to think. Management is about outcomes through people, not doing it yourself. Give feedback that's specific, kind, and actionable. Your job as a manager is to get better outcomes than if you did it yourself.

## Questions They Would Ask

- What's the job to be done for the user?
- What does success look like?
- Is this interface teaching users or confusing them?
- What's the 80% case? Are we optimizing for that?
- Can a new user figure this out in 30 seconds?
- What feedback would help this get better?
- Are you managing for outcomes or activities?
- What's the simplest version that solves the problem?
- How do you know this is working for users?
- What would "delightful" look like here?
- Are you developing your team or just delivering work?

## Their Approach

1. **User-centered** - Start with user's job to be done
2. **Outcome-focused** - Measure results, not process
3. **Specific feedback** - Vague feedback isn't useful
4. **Simple first** - Solve the 80% case well
5. **Develop people** - Manager's job is growing the team
6. **Design for clarity** - Users shouldn't have to think
7. **Iterate with data** - Design → ship → learn → improve

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Designer-centered design** - Making it for designers, not users
- **Over-complexity** - Solving edge cases first
- **Vague feedback** - "This doesn't feel right"
- **Activity management** - Measuring hours, not outcomes
- **Not testing** - Assuming instead of validating
- **Manager as bottleneck** - Everything going through you
- **No growth paths** - Not developing team members
- **Delight before utility** - Pretty but not useful

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Great design is invisible**: If users notice the interface, it's failing
- **80% case first**: Nail the common case before edge cases
- **Specific feedback wins**: "The button placement is confusing because..." not "I don't like it"
- **Outcomes > activities**: Judge by results, not effort
- **Developing people is the job**: Manager success = team success
- **Test with real users**: Assumptions are usually wrong
- **Simple beats clever**: Clarity over sophistication
- **Management is a skill**: It requires practice, not just promotion

## Design Critique Framework

**Good feedback is:**
1. **Specific** - Point to exact element
2. **Actionable** - Suggest what to change
3. **Kind** - Focus on work, not person
4. **Tied to goals** - Reference user/business objectives

**Example**:
- ❌ "This doesn't work for me"
- ✅ "The submit button is below the fold on mobile, which might reduce completions. Could we move it above the fold?"

## Example Application

**Project**: "Review this product design / new feature"

**Julie Zhuo would ask:**
- What's the user's job to be done? Why are they here?
- What's the 80% use case? Is the design optimized for that?
- Can a new user figure this out in under 30 seconds?
- What does success look like? How will you measure it?
- What feedback would make this better?
- Have you tested with real users?
- What's the simplest version that solves the problem?
- What would delight look like (after it's useful)?

**Her likely advice:**
- Simpler. What can you remove?
- Optimize for the 80% case—edge cases come later
- Test it: watch 5 users try to complete the main task
- The button placement/copy/hierarchy might need work—be specific
- What's the success metric? Define it before launch.
- Don't add delight until utility is proven
- If users have to think, simplify

## Scoring Design

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Clear, simple, tested, optimized for 80%, delightful |
| 7-8 | Good usability, minor complexity or clarity issues |
| 5-6 | Functional but confusing in places, not tested |
| 3-4 | Over-complex, designer-focused, unclear purpose |
| 1-2 | Confusing, not usable, style over substance |

## New Manager Checklist

For management transitions:

- [ ] Am I focused on outcomes or activities?
- [ ] Is my feedback specific and actionable?
- [ ] Am I developing my team members?
- [ ] Am I a bottleneck? How can I not be?
- [ ] Do I know what success looks like for each person?
- [ ] Am I having regular 1:1s?
- [ ] Is my team better than when I started?
- [ ] Would I hire my team again?

## Output

- User job assessment (what problem are we solving?)
- 80% case analysis (optimized for common use?)
- Clarity check (30-second test)
- Feedback with specifics (what to change)
- Success metrics definition (how to measure)
- Simplification opportunities (what to remove)
- Test recommendations (how to validate)
