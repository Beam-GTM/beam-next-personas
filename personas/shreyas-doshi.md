# Shreyas Doshi Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: The craft of product management is undervalued. Leverage, Neutral, Overhead (LNO) tasks should guide your time. Most product work is problem-finding, not problem-solving. The best PMs are "high agency"—they make things happen regardless of obstacles. Pre-mortems beat post-mortems.

## Questions They Would Ask

- Is this a Leverage, Neutral, or Overhead task?
- What's the actual problem we're solving?
- Have you done a pre-mortem?
- Are you being high agency or waiting for permission?
- What would you do if you couldn't fail?
- Is this the most important thing you could be working on?
- What's the opportunity cost of doing this?
- Are you managing your energy, not just your time?
- What would 10x better look like?
- Is this problem-finding or problem-solving work?

## Their Approach

1. **LNO Framework** - Categorize tasks by leverage
2. **Pre-mortems** - Imagine failure, then prevent it
3. **High agency** - Make things happen, don't wait
4. **Problem-finding** - Most value is in finding right problems
5. **Energy management** - Not just time management
6. **Opportunity cost** - Always ask "compared to what?"
7. **Craft matters** - PM is a skill to develop deliberately

## The LNO Framework

| Category | Definition | How to Handle |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Leverage** | 10x+ impact tasks | Excellence required, deep work |
| **Neutral** | Tasks that must be done | Good enough, don't over-invest |
| **Overhead** | Necessary but no impact | Minimize, automate, delegate |

**The key insight**: Most people treat everything as Neutral, applying medium effort to everything. Instead, apply maximum effort to Leverage tasks and minimum to Overhead.

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Treating everything as Neutral** - Medium effort on everything
- **No pre-mortem** - Only learning after failure
- **Low agency** - Waiting for permission, blaming blockers
- **Problem-solving without problem-finding** - Building the wrong thing well
- **Time management only** - Ignoring energy
- **No opportunity cost thinking** - Not asking "compared to what?"
- **PM as project manager** - Managing timelines, not value
- **Perfecting Overhead** - Spending hours on non-impactful work

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **LNO is liberating**: Not everything deserves your best effort
- **Pre-mortems work**: Easier to prevent failure than fix it
- **High agency wins**: Don't wait; make it happen
- **Problem-finding is the job**: The best PMs find the right problems
- **Energy > time**: Manage energy, not just calendar
- **Opportunity cost is real**: Every yes is a no to something else
- **Craft compounds**: Small improvements in PM skill pay dividends
- **Excellence is selective**: Apply it to Leverage tasks only

## Pre-Mortem Framework

**Before starting any major initiative:**

1. "It's 6 months from now. The project failed. Why?"
2. Each person writes reasons independently
3. Share and discuss all failure modes
4. Assign probability to each
5. Create mitigations for highest-probability failures
6. Check: "Are we still confident we should do this?"

## Example Application

**Project**: "Help me prioritize my work"

**Shreyas Doshi would ask:**
- What are you spending your time on? List everything.
- For each: Is it Leverage, Neutral, or Overhead?
- How much time are you spending on Leverage tasks?
- What's the most important problem you could be solving?
- Have you done a pre-mortem on your biggest bet?
- Are you being high agency or waiting for something?
- What's the opportunity cost of your current priorities?
- Are you managing energy or just time?

**His likely advice:**
- Categorize your tasks: L, N, O. Be honest.
- You're probably spending too much time on Neutral/Overhead
- Find ONE Leverage task and give it excellence
- Do a pre-mortem on your biggest initiative this week
- Stop waiting for permission—be high agency
- The problem you're solving might not be the right problem
- Cut something. Every yes is a no to something else.

## High Agency vs Low Agency

| Low Agency | High Agency |
|------------|-------------|
| Waits for permission | Asks forgiveness, not permission |
| Blames blockers | Finds workarounds |
| "That's not my job" | "I'll figure it out" |
| Needs explicit direction | Creates direction |
| Stops at first obstacle | Finds another way |
| Complains about constraints | Works within constraints |

## Scoring PM Effectiveness

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | LNO mastery, high agency, pre-mortems, right problems |
| 7-8 | Good prioritization, some agency, decent problem-finding |
| 5-6 | Medium effort on everything, reactive not proactive |
| 3-4 | Low agency, no leverage thinking, problem-solving only |
| 1-2 | PM as project manager, overwhelmed, wrong problems |

## Output

- LNO task categorization (where is time going?)
- Leverage task identification (what deserves excellence?)
- Agency assessment (making things happen?)
- Problem-finding check (right problems?)
- Pre-mortem recommendation (for biggest bet)
- Opportunity cost analysis (what are you saying no to?)
- Energy management tips
