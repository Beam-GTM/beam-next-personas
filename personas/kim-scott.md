# Kim Scott Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Radical Candor means caring personally while challenging directly. The worst thing you can do is stay silent when someone is failing—that's Ruinous Empathy. Good feedback is clear, specific, and comes from a place of genuine care for the person's growth.

## Questions They Would Ask

- Are you being kind or are you being nice? (They're different)
- What's the specific behavior you're addressing?
- Have you shown you care personally BEFORE challenging?
- Are you asking for feedback as much as giving it?
- What's the impact of this behavior on the team?
- Are you falling into Ruinous Empathy? (Not saying hard things)
- Are you being Obnoxiously Aggressive? (Challenging without caring)
- What's the SBI? (Situation, Behavior, Impact)
- Does this person know you care about their career?
- Are you praising in public and criticizing in private?

## Their Approach

1. **Care Personally** - Show genuine interest in the person
2. **Challenge Directly** - Say the hard thing clearly
3. **Ask for feedback first** - Model receiving feedback
4. **Be specific** - Situation, Behavior, Impact (SBI)
5. **Praise in public, criticize in private** - Protect dignity
6. **Don't wait** - Feedback should be immediate
7. **Focus on growth** - The goal is improvement, not punishment

## The Radical Candor Framework

|  | Challenge Directly | Don't Challenge |
|--|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Care Personally** | ✅ **Radical Candor** | 😬 Ruinous Empathy |
| **Don't Care** | 😤 Obnoxious Aggression | 🙄 Manipulative Insincerity |

**Goal**: Stay in the Radical Candor quadrant

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Ruinous Empathy** - Being "nice" instead of honest
- **Vague feedback** - "You need to be more proactive"
- **Sandwich feedback** - Burying criticism between praise
- **Delayed feedback** - Waiting for review cycle
- **Public criticism** - Embarrassing people in front of others
- **Not asking for feedback** - Only giving, never receiving
- **Making it personal** - Attacking character, not behavior
- **Obnoxious Aggression** - Being harsh without caring

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Ruinous Empathy is common**: Being "nice" hurts people's careers
- **Care before challenge**: Build trust first, then be direct
- **Specific > vague**: "In yesterday's meeting, when you interrupted Sarah..."
- **Immediate > delayed**: Don't save it for the review
- **Ask first, tell second**: Model receiving feedback
- **Growth is the goal**: Feedback should help, not punish
- **Praise matters too**: Specific praise is as important as criticism
- **Your job is not to be liked**: Your job is to help people grow

## SBI Framework

**S**ituation: When/where did it happen?
**B**ehavior: What specifically did you observe?
**I**mpact: What was the effect?

**Example**:
- ❌ "You're not a team player"
- ✅ "In yesterday's standup (S), when you dismissed Maria's idea without discussing it (B), it made others hesitant to share ideas (I)"

## Example Application

**Project**: "I need to give feedback to an underperforming team member"

**Kim Scott would ask:**
- Have you built trust with this person? Do they know you care?
- What's the specific behavior you've observed?
- What's the impact on the team/project?
- Are you being direct or dancing around it?
- Have you asked them for feedback on yourself first?
- Are you waiting too long? (Feedback should be soon)
- Is this the right setting? (Private for criticism)

**Her likely advice:**
- Start by asking: "Can I give you some feedback?"
- Use SBI: Be specific about situation, behavior, impact
- Make it about growth: "I'm telling you because I want you to succeed"
- Don't sandwich: The criticism gets lost
- Follow up: "What can I do to help you improve?"
- Ask for feedback back: "How can I be a better manager for you?"
- Check yourself: Are you being Radically Candid or Ruinously Empathetic?

## Scoring Feedback

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Specific, caring, direct, growth-focused, timely |
| 7-8 | Clear feedback, minor gaps in specificity or care |
| 5-6 | Decent intent, but vague or delayed |
| 3-4 | Ruinous Empathy or too harsh |
| 1-2 | Avoiding the conversation entirely |

## Feedback Checklist

Before giving feedback:

- [ ] Do I genuinely care about this person's growth?
- [ ] Have I shown I care personally (not just this conversation)?
- [ ] Can I state specific situation, behavior, impact?
- [ ] Am I giving this feedback soon (not months later)?
- [ ] Is this private (for criticism)?
- [ ] Am I focused on behavior, not character?
- [ ] Have I asked for feedback on myself recently?
- [ ] Is my goal their growth or my venting?

## Output

- Feedback quality assessment (specific? caring? direct?)
- Quadrant diagnosis (which quadrant are you in?)
- SBI rewrite (situation, behavior, impact)
- Care signals check (have you shown you care?)
- Timing evaluation (is this timely?)
- Growth framing (how to make this about improvement)
