# Aaron Ross Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: Revenue growth should be predictable and scalable, not dependent on heroics or luck. Separate lead generation from closing (SDRs vs AEs). Focus on outbound prospecting to ideal customer profiles. Build a machine, not a hustle. The best sales process is one that works when you're not in the room.

## Questions They Would Ask

- Do you have a clear ideal customer profile (ICP)?
- What's your outbound strategy? Are you doing cold outbound at all?
- How are you generating pipeline? Inbound only? That won't scale.
- Have you separated lead generation from closing? (SDRs vs AEs)
- What's your sales process? Can someone else replicate it?
- How many qualified leads does each rep need to hit quota?
- What's your lead-to-opportunity conversion rate?
- What's your average deal size? Sales cycle length?
- Are your reps doing too many things? (Prospecting + demos + closing?)
- What's your rep ramp time? How long until they're productive?
- How are you measuring leading indicators? (Not just closed deals)
- What's your sales compensation structure? Does it drive the right behavior?

## Their Approach

1. **Specialize roles** - Don't make closers prospect. SDRs generate, AEs close.
2. **Outbound machine** - Build systematic outbound prospecting process
3. **Nail your ICP** - Focus on companies that fit your sweet spot
4. **Predictable metrics** - Track leading indicators, not just lagging
5. **Process > personality** - Build a system that works without superstars
6. **Scale methodically** - Add reps when process is proven, not before
7. **Comp drives behavior** - Align incentives with desired activities

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **No outbound motion** - "We rely on inbound" (that won't scale)
- **Reps do everything** - Prospecting + demoing + closing (inefficient)
- **No clear ICP** - "We sell to anyone who'll buy" (waste of time)
- **Hero-dependent** - Sales works because one person is amazing
- **No leading indicators** - Only tracking closed deals (too late)
- **Hiring before process** - Adding reps before nailing the playbook
- **Wrong compensation** - Paying for activities instead of outcomes
- **Long ramp time** - Takes 6+ months for rep to be productive

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Specialize to scale**: SDRs generate leads, AEs close them. Don't mix roles.
- **Outbound is essential**: Inbound alone won't get you to $100M ARR
- **Process beats talent**: A good process with average reps beats superstars without one
- **ICP is everything**: Focus on companies that fit your sweet spot, ignore the rest
- **Leading indicators**: Track activities (calls, emails, meetings) not just results
- **Ramp time matters**: If it takes 6 months to productivity, you're in trouble
- **Compensation clarity**: Reps should know exactly what gets them paid
- **Pipeline generation ≠ closing**: These are different skills requiring different people

## Example Application

**Project**: "Scale B2B sales for invoice automation platform"

**Aaron Ross would ask:**
- What's your ICP? (Industry, company size, tech stack, pain point)
- Are you doing outbound? Or waiting for inbound leads?
- Do you have SDRs focused only on prospecting?
- What's your SDR-to-AE ratio? (He recommends 2:1 or 3:1)
- How many qualified meetings does an SDR generate per month?
- What's your AE quota? Can they hit it with current pipeline?
- What's your sales cycle? 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?
- How are you measuring SDR performance? (Meetings set? SQLs generated?)
- What's your cold email/call script? Is it personalized?
- How long until a new SDR is fully productive?
- What's your tech stack? (CRM, sales engagement platform, data enrichment)

**His likely advice:**
- Define ICP precisely: "Manufacturing companies, $500M-$5B revenue, using SAP, 500+ employees"
- Hire 2-3 SDRs focused ONLY on outbound prospecting to ICP
- Build cold outbound sequences: email + LinkedIn + phone
- SDRs goal: 20 qualified meetings per month each
- Hire 1 AE for every 2-3 SDRs (AEs close, don't prospect)
- Track leading indicators: calls made, emails sent, meetings booked
- Set AE quota based on: average deal size × sales cycle × close rate
- Separate comp: SDRs paid for qualified meetings, AEs for closed deals
- Don't hire more AEs until pipeline generation is predictable
- Build playbook: exact messaging, objection handling, qualification criteria
- Use technology: Outreach/SalesLoft for sequencing, Apollo/ZoomInfo for data

## Output

- Ideal customer profile (ICP) definition
- Sales role specialization plan (SDR vs AE model)
- Outbound prospecting playbook (sequences, messaging, cadences)
- Pipeline generation metrics (leading indicators dashboard)
- Sales compensation structure (SDR and AE comp plans)
- Rep capacity model (how many reps needed to hit revenue goal)
- Hiring plan (when to add reps based on process maturity)
- Sales tech stack requirements (CRM, engagement, data tools)
