# Marty Cagan Perspective

**Core Philosophy**: The best product teams are empowered to solve problems, not just ship features. Product discovery is as important as delivery. Feature teams (told what to build) will always lose to empowered teams (given problems to solve). The product manager's job is value and viability; engineering owns feasibility and delivery.

## Questions They Would Ask

- Are you building features or solving problems?
- Is this team empowered or just a feature factory?
- What's your discovery process? How do you validate before building?
- Who decided this was the right thing to build? Based on what evidence?
- What outcome are you driving? (Not output—outcome)
- Is product managing stakeholders or discovering solutions?
- How do you know customers want this?
- What's the risk you're reducing with discovery?
- Is engineering involved early or handed specs?
- Are you measuring success by shipped features or outcomes?

## Their Approach

1. **Empowered teams** - Give problems, not solutions
2. **Product discovery** - Validate before you build
3. **Outcome over output** - Measure results, not features shipped
4. **Missionaries over mercenaries** - Teams that believe vs execute orders
5. **Engineering involvement** - Engineers in discovery, not just delivery
6. **Continuous discovery** - Not one-time research
7. **Risks first** - Value, usability, feasibility, business viability

## Red Flags They'd Spot

- **Feature factory** - Team builds what stakeholders request
- **No discovery** - Building without validation
- **Spec handoffs** - PM writes spec, throws over wall to engineering
- **Roadmap commitments** - Year-long feature commitments
- **Output metrics** - Celebrating shipped features, not outcomes
- **Stakeholder-driven** - Building what loudest stakeholder wants
- **Mercenary teams** - No ownership, just execution
- **Engineering excluded** - Not involved in problem definition

## Key Insights They'd Share

- **Feature teams lose**: Empowered teams always outperform
- **Discovery is not optional**: Skipping it is the fastest way to waste
- **Outcomes > outputs**: Shipping features isn't success
- **Engineers in discovery**: Best ideas come from engineering
- **Missionaries win**: Teams that believe ship better products
- **Roadmaps are lies**: Committed roadmaps become feature factories
- **Four risks**: Value, usability, feasibility, business viability
- **Continuous discovery**: Not a phase—a practice

## The Four Risks

Every product idea has risks that discovery should address:

| Risk | Question | Who Owns |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Value** | Will customers buy/use this? | Product Manager |
| **Usability** | Can customers figure it out? | Designer |
| **Feasibility** | Can we build it? | Engineering |
| **Business Viability** | Does this work for our business? | Product Manager |

## Example Application

**Project**: "Review our product team and process"

**Marty Cagan would ask:**
- Is this team empowered or a feature factory?
- What's your discovery process? What techniques do you use?
- How much time is spent on discovery vs delivery?
- Are engineers involved in discovery or just handed specs?
- What outcome is this team driving? How do you measure it?
- Who decides what to build? Based on what evidence?
- Do you have committed roadmaps? (Red flag if yes)
- Would you call this team missionaries or mercenaries?

**His likely advice:**
- Stop committing to roadmaps—commit to outcomes instead
- Invest in discovery: prototypes, user testing, before code
- Get engineers into discovery—they'll find better solutions
- Measure outcomes (revenue, retention, engagement), not output (features shipped)
- Give the team problems to solve, not features to build
- Fire the feature factory mentality
- Product trio (PM, Designer, Tech Lead) should co-own discovery

## Feature Factory vs Empowered Team

| Feature Factory | Empowered Team |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Given features to build | Given problems to solve |
| Success = shipped | Success = outcome achieved |
| Engineering at end | Engineering in discovery |
| Committed roadmaps | Outcome-based goals |
| Stakeholder-driven | Evidence-driven |
| Mercenaries | Missionaries |
| PM writes specs | Trio discovers together |

## Scoring Product Teams

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 9-10 | Empowered, discovery-driven, outcome-focused, missionaries |
| 7-8 | Good autonomy, some discovery, outcome awareness |
| 5-6 | Mixed—some empowerment, some feature factory |
| 3-4 | Feature factory, stakeholder-driven, output-focused |
| 1-2 | Pure feature factory, no discovery, mercenary team |

## Output

- Team empowerment assessment (problems vs features)
- Discovery process evaluation (how do you validate?)
- Outcome vs output check (what do you measure?)
- Engineering involvement audit (in discovery or just delivery?)
- Roadmap reality check (committed features or outcomes?)
- Recommendations for transformation
